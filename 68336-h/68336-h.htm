<p class="fs120 lht">My warm thanks are due to Mr. C. T. Atkinson, M.A.,
of Exeter College, Oxford, who most kindly read
through the proofs of the chapter on the War
of American Independence and made some valuable
corrections; and also to Mr. C. Atchley, I.S.O.,
Librarian of the Colonial Office, who has given
me constant help. Two recent and most valuable
books have greatly facilitated the study
of Canadian history since 1763, viz., <i>Documents
relating to the Constitutional History of Canada,
1759-91</i>, selected and edited with notes by Messrs.
Shortt and Doughty, and <i>Canadian Constitutional
Development</i>, by Messrs. Egerton and Grant.
I want to express my grateful acknowledgements
of the help which these books have given to me.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE PROCLAMATION OF 1763, AND
PONTIAC’S WAR</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The
Peace of
Paris.</div>

<p>On the 10th of February, 1763, the Peace of Paris was
signed between Great Britain, France, and Spain. Under
its provisions all North America, east of the Mississippi,
which had been owned or claimed by France, was, with
the exception of the city of New Orleans, transferred to
Great Britain, the navigation of the Mississippi being
thrown open to the subjects of both Powers. The English
also received Florida from Spain, in return for Havana
given back to its old owners. Under a treaty secretly
concluded in November, 1762, when the preliminaries of
the general treaty were signed, Spain took over from
France New Orleans and Louisiana west of the Mississippi,
the actual transfer being completed in 1769. Thus
France lost all hold on the North American continent,
while retaining various West Indian islands, and fishing
rights on part of the Newfoundland coast, which were
supplemented by possession of the two adjacent islets of
St. Pierre and Miquelon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Proclamation
of 1763.</div>

<p>In the autumn of the year 1763, on the 7th of October,
King George III issued a proclamation constituting
‘within the countries and islands, ceded and confirmed
to us by the said treaty, four distinct and separate governments,
styled and called by the names of Quebec, East
Florida, West Florida, and Grenada’. Of these four
governments, the first alone requires special notice. The
government of Grenada was in the West Indies, and the
governments of East and West Florida, excluding a
debatable strip of territory which was annexed to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
State of Georgia, were co-extensive with the new province
which had been acquired from Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Boundaries
of
the
government
of
Quebec.</div>

<p>The limits assigned by the proclamation to the government
of Quebec were as follows: north of the St. Lawrence,
the new province was ‘bounded on the Labrador coast
by the river St. John, and from thence by a line drawn
from the head of that river, through the Lake St. John,
to the south end of the Lake Nipissim’. The river
St. John flows into the St. Lawrence over against the
western end of the island of Anticosti; Lake St. John is
the lake out of which the Saguenay takes its course;
Lake Nipissim or Nipissing is connected by French river
with Georgian Bay and Lake Huron. The line in question,
therefore, was drawn due south-west from Lake St. John
parallel to the St. Lawrence.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> From the southern end of
Lake Nipissim the line, according to the terms of the
proclamation, crossed the St. Lawrence and Lake Champlain
in 45 degrees of north latitude. In other words, it
was drawn due south-east, to the west of and parallel to
the Ottawa river, until it struck the St. Lawrence, where
the 45th parallel of north latitude meets that river at the
foot of the Long Sault Rapids. It then followed the
45th parallel eastward across the outlet of Lake Champlain,
and subsequently, diverging to the north-east, was
carried ‘along the highlands which divide the rivers that
empty themselves into the said river St. Lawrence from
those which fall into the sea’. Further east it skirted
‘the north coast of the Baye des Chaleurs and the coast of
the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Cape Rosieres’, which last
named cape is at the extreme end of the Gaspé peninsula.
The line then again crossed the St. Lawrence by the
western end of the island of Anticosti, and joined the
river St. John.</p>

<p>Thus, south of the St. Lawrence, the boundary of the
province of Quebec was, roughly speaking, much the same
as it is at the present day. Its westernmost limit was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
also not far different, the Ottawa river being in the main
the existing boundary between the provinces of Ontario
and Quebec. On the north and north-east, on the other
hand, the government of Quebec in 1763 covered a smaller
area than is now the case. ‘To the end that the open
and free fishery of our subjects may be extended to and
carried on upon the coast of Labrador and the adjacent
islands,’ ran the terms of the proclamation, ‘we have
thought fit, with the advice of our said Privy Council, to
put all that coast from the river St. John’s to Hudson’s
Straits, together with the islands of Anticosti and Madelaine,
and all other smaller islands lying upon the said
coast, under the care and inspection of our Governor of
Newfoundland.’ To the government of Nova Scotia were
annexed the conquered islands of St. Jean or St. John’s,
now Prince Edward Island, and Isle Royale or Cape
Breton, ‘with the lesser islands adjacent thereto.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Encouragement
of military
and
naval
settlers.</div>

<p>It was greatly desired to encourage British settlement
in North America, and special regard was had in this respect
to the soldiers and sailors who in North American lands
and waters had deserved so well of their country. Accordingly
the proclamation contained a special provision
for grants of land, within the old and the new colonies
alike, to retired officers of the army who had served in
North America during the late war; to private soldiers
who had been disbanded in and were actually living in
North America; and to retired officers of the navy who
had served in North America ‘at the times of the reduction
of Louisbourg and Quebec’. It was thought also by the
Lords of Trade that confidence and encouragement would
be given to intending settlers, if at the outset they were
publicly notified of the form of government under which
they would live. <span class="sidenote">Provision for a legislature and for the administration of justice.</span> Hence the proclamation provided, as
regards the new colonies, ‘that so soon as the state and
circumstances of the said colonies will admit thereof,’ the
governors ‘shall, with the advice and consent of the
members of our Council, summon and call General Assemblies
within the said governments respectively, in such<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
manner and form as is used and directed in those colonies
and provinces in America which are under our immediate
government’. The governors, councils, and representatives
of the people, when duly constituted, were empowered
to make laws for the public peace, welfare, and good
government of the colonies, provided that such laws
should be ‘as near as may be agreeable to the laws of
England, and under such regulations and restrictions as
are used in other colonies.’ Pending the constitution of
the legislatures, the inhabitants and settlers were to enjoy
the benefit of the laws of England, and the governors
were empowered, with the advice of their councils, to
establish courts of justice, to hear and decide civil and
criminal cases alike, in accordance as far as possible with
the laws of England, a right of appeal being given in civil
cases to the Privy Council in England. It was not stated
in the proclamation, but it was embodied in the governors’
instructions, that until General Assemblies could be constituted,
the governors, with the advice of their councils,
were to make rules and regulations for peace, order, and
good government, all matters being reserved ‘that shall
any ways tend to affect the life, limb, or liberty of the
subject, or to the imposing any duties or taxes’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Western
territories.</div>

<p>In June, 1762, James Murray, then military governor
of the district of Quebec, and subsequently the first civil
governor of the province, wrote that it was impossible to
ascertain exactly what part of North America the French
styled Canada. In the previous March General Gage,
then military governor of Montreal, had written that he
could not discover ‘that the limits betwixt Louisiana
and Canada were distinctly described, so as to be publicly
known’, but that from the trade which Canadians had
carried on under the authority of their governors, he
judged ‘not only the lakes, which are indisputable, but
the whole course of the Mississippi from its heads to its
junction with the Illinois, to have been comprehended
by the French in the government of Canada’. In June,
1763, the Lords of Trade, when in obedience to the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
commands they were considering the terms and the scope
of the coming proclamation, reported that ‘Canada, as
possessed and claimed by the French, consisted of an
immense tract of country including as well the whole lands
to the westward indefinitely which was the subject of
their Indian trade, as all that country from the southern
bank of the river St. Lawrence, where they carried on
their encroachments’.</p>

<p>After the Peace of Paris had been signed, the King,
through Lord Egremont, who had succeeded Chatham as
Secretary of State for the southern department, referred
the whole subject of his new colonial possessions to the
Lords of Trade. In doing so he called special attention
to the necessity of keeping peace among the North
American Indians—a subject which was shortly to be
illustrated by Pontiac’s war—and to this end he laid
stress upon the desirability of protecting their persons,
their property, and their privileges, and ‘most cautiously
guarding against any invasion or occupation of their
hunting lands, the possession of which is to be acquired
by fair purchase only’. The Lords of Trade recommended
adoption of ‘the general proposition of leaving a large
tract of country round the Great Lakes as an Indian
country, open to trade, but not to grants and settlements;
the limits of such territory will be sufficiently ascertained
by the bounds to be given to the governors of Canada
and Florida on the north and south, and the Mississippi
on the west; and by the strict directions to be given to
Your Majesty’s several governors of your ancient colonies
for preventing their making any new grants of lands
beyond certain fixed limits to be laid down in the instructions
for that purpose’. Egremont answered that the
King demurred to leaving so large a tract of land without
a civil jurisdiction and open, as being derelict, to possible
foreign intrusion; and that, in His opinion, the commission
of the Governor of Canada should include ‘all the lakes,
viz. Ontario, Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior’, and
‘all the country as far north and west as the limits of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
Hudson’s Bay Company and the Mississippi’. At the
same time He cordially concurred in not permitting grants
of lands or settlements in these regions, which should be
‘for the present left unsettled, for the Indian tribes to
hunt in, but open to a free trade for all the colonies’.
The Lords of Trade were not convinced. They deprecated
annexing this western territory to any colony, and
particularly to Canada, on three grounds: The first was
that annexation to Canada might imply that the British
title to these lands was the result of the late treaty and of
the cession of Canada, whereas it rested on antecedent
rights, and it was important not to let the Indians form
a wrong impression on this head by being brought under
the government of the old French province. The second
ground was that, if the Indian territory was annexed to
one particular province and subjected to its laws, that
province would have an undue advantage over the other
provinces or colonies in respect to the Indian trade, which
it was the intention of the Crown to leave open as far as
possible to all British subjects. The third objection to
annexing the territory to Canada was that the laws of
the province could not be enforced except by means
of garrisons established at different posts throughout the
area, which would necessitate either that the Governor
of Canada should always be commander-in-chief of the
forces in North America, or that there should be constant
friction between the civil governor and the military commanders.
This reasoning prevailed, and the lands which
it was contemplated to reserve for the use of the Indians
were not annexed to any particular colony or assigned to
any one colonial government.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Provisions
for the
protection
of
the
Indians.</div>

<p>With this great area, covering the present province of
Ontario and the north central states of the American
Republic, the Royal proclamation dealt as follows:
‘Whereas it is just and reasonable, and essential to our
interest, and the security of our colonies, that the several
nations or tribes of Indians, with whom we are connected,
and who live under our protection, should not be molested<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
or disturbed in the possession of such parts of our dominions
and territories as, not having been ceded to or
purchased by us, are reserved to them, or any of them, as
their hunting grounds ... we do further declare it to be
our Royal will and pleasure, for the present as aforesaid, to
reserve under our sovereignty, protection, and dominion,
for the use of the said Indians, all the lands and territories
not included within the limits of our said three new
governments, or within the limits of the territory granted
to the Hudson’s Bay Company, as also all the lands and
territories lying to the westward of the sources of the
rivers which fall into the sea from the west and north-west
as aforesaid; and we do hereby strictly forbid, on pain
of our displeasure, all our loving subjects from making
any purchases or settlements whatever, or taking possession
of any of the lands above reserved, without our especial
leave and licence for that purpose first obtained.’</p>

<p>Thus North America, outside the recognized limits of
the old or new colonies, was for the time being constituted
a great native reserve; and even within the limits of
the colonies it was provided ‘that no private person do
presume to make any purchase from the said Indians of
any lands reserved to the said Indians within those parts
of our colonies where we have thought proper to allow
settlement: but that, if at any time any of the said
Indians should be inclined to dispose of the said lands, the
same shall be purchased only for us, in our name, at some
public meeting or assembly of the said Indians, to be held
for that purpose by the governor or commander-in-chief
of our colony respectively within which they shall lie’.
Trade with the Indians was to be free and open to all
British subjects, but the traders were to take out licences,
and, while no fees were to be charged for such licences,
the traders were to give security that they would observe
any regulations laid down for the benefit of the trade.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span></p>

<p>It is impossible to study the correspondence which
preceded the Proclamation of 1763, without recognizing
that those who framed it were anxious to frame a just
and liberal policy, but its terms bear witness to the almost <span class="sidenote">Difficulties of the situation.</span>
insuperable difficulties which attend the acquisition of
a great borderland of colonization, difficulties which in
a few years’ time were largely responsible for the American
War of Independence. How to administer a new domain
with equity and sound judgement; how to give to new
subjects, acquired by conquest, the privileges enjoyed by
the old colonies; how to reconcile the claims of the old
colonies, whose inland borders had never been demarcated,
with the undoubted rights of native races; how to promote
trade and settlement without depriving the Indians of
their heritage;—such were the problems which the British
Government was called upon to face and if possible to
solve. The proclamation was in a few years’ time followed
up by the Quebec Act of 1774, in connexion with
which more will be said as to these thorny questions. In
the meantime, even before the proclamation had been
issued, the English had on their hands what was perhaps
the most dangerous and widespread native rising which
ever threatened their race in the New World.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
policy in
North
America.</div>

<p>The great French scheme for a North American dominion
depended upon securing control of the waterways and
control of the natives. Even before the dawn of the
eighteenth century, Count Frontenac among governors,
La Salle among pioneers, saw clearly the importance of
gaining the West and the ways to the West; and they
realized that, in order to attain that object, the narrows
on the inland waters, and the portages from one lake or
river to another, must be commanded; that the Indians
who were hostile to France must be subdued, and that
the larger number of red men, who liked French ways
and French leadership, must be given permanent evidence
of the value of French protection and the strength of
French statesmanship.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
French
posts in
the West.</div>

<p>Along the line of lakes and rivers in course of years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
French forts were placed. Fort Frontenac, first founded
in 1673 by the great French governor whose name it bore,
guarded, on the site of the present city of Kingston, the
outlet of the St. Lawrence from Lake Ontario. Fort
Niagara, begun by La Salle in the winter of 1678-9, on
the eastern bank of the Niagara river, near its entrance
into Lake Ontario, covered the portage from that lake to
Lake Erie. Fort Detroit, dating from the first years of
the eighteenth century, stood by the river which carries
the waters of Lake Huron and Lake St. Clair into Lake
Erie. Its founder was La Mothe Cadillac. The post at
Michillimackinac was at the entrance of Lake Michigan.
From Lake Erie to the Ohio were two lines of forts. The
main line began with Presque Isle on the southern shore
of the lake, and ended with Fort Duquesne, afterwards
renamed Pittsburg, the intermediate posts being Fort
Le Bœuf at the head of French Creek, and Venango where
that stream joins the Alleghany. Further west, past
the intermediate fort of Sandusky, which stood on the
southern shore of Lake Erie, there was a second series of
outposts, of which we hear little in the course of the Seven
Years’ War. The Maumee river flows into the south-western
end of Lake Erie, and on it, at a point where there
was a portage to the Wabash river, was constructed Fort
Miami, on or near the site of the later American Fort
Wayne. On the Wabash, which joins the Ohio not very
far above the confluence of the latter river with the
Mississippi, were two French posts, Fort Ouatanon and,
lower down its course, Fort Vincennes. On the central
Mississippi the chief nucleus of French trade and influence
was Fort Chartres. It stood on the eastern bank of the
river, eighty to ninety miles above the confluence of the
Ohio, and but a few miles north of the point where
the Kaskaskia river flows into the Mississippi. On the
Kaskaskia, among the Illinois Indians, there was a French
outpost, and settlement fringed the eastern side of the
Mississippi northwards to Fort Chartres. Above that fort
there was a road running north on the same side to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Cahokia, a little below and on the opposite side to the
confluence of the Missouri; and in 1763 a French settler
crossed the Mississippi, and opened a store on the site of
the present city of St. Louis. The posts on the Mississippi
were, both for trading and for political purposes, connected
with Louisiana rather than with Canada; and, though the
Peace of Paris had ceded to Great Britain the soil on which
they stood, the French had not been disturbed by any
assertion of British sovereignty prior to the war which
is associated with the name of the Indian chief Pontiac.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
rising of
Pontiac.</div>

<p>The rising which Pontiac headed came too late for the
Indians to be permanently successful. In any case it
could have had, eventually, but one ending, the overthrow
of the red men: but, while it lasted, it seriously delayed
the consolidation of English authority over the West.
After most wars of conquest there supervene minor wars
or rebellions, waves of the receding tide when high-water
is past, disturbances due to local mismanagement and
local discontent; but the Indian war, which began in 1763, <span class="sidenote">Its special characteristics.</span>
had special characteristics. In the first place, the rising
was entirely a native revolt. No doubt it was fomented
by malcontent French traders and settlers, disseminating
tales of English iniquities and raising hopes of a French
revival; but very few Frenchmen were to be found in
the fighting line; the warriors were red men, not white.
In the second place it was a rising of the Western Indians,
of the tribes who had not known in any measure the
strength of the English, and who had known, more as
friends than as subjects, the guidance and the spirit of
the French. Of the Six Nations, the Senecas alone, the
westernmost members of the Iroquois Confederacy, joined
in the struggle, and the centre of disturbance was further
west. In the third place the rising was more carefully
planned, the conception was more statesmanlike, the
action was more organized, than has usually been the
case among savage races. There was unity of plan and
harmony in action, which betokened leadership of no
ordinary kind. The leader was the Ottawa chief Pontiac.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian
suspicions
of the
English.</div>

<p>‘When the Indian nations saw the French power, as
it were, annihilated in North America, they began to
imagine that they ought to have made greater and earlier
efforts in their favour. The Indians had not been for a
long time so jealous of them as they were of us. The
French seemed more intent on trade than settlement.
Finding themselves infinitely weaker than the English,
they supplied, as well as they could, the place of strength
by policy, and paid a much more flattering and systematic
attention to the Indians than we had ever done. Our
superiority in this war rendered our regard to this people
still less, which had always been too little.’<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The Indians
were frightened too, says the same writer, by the English
possession of the chains of forts: ‘they beheld in every
little garrison the germ of a future colony.’ Ripe for
revolt, and never yet subdued, as their countrymen further
east had been, they found a strong man of their own race
to lead them, and tried conclusions with the dominant
white race in North America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Rogers’
mission
to
Detroit.</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1760, after the capitulation of Montreal,
General Amherst sent Major Robert Rogers, the
New Hampshire Ranger, to receive the submission of the
French forts on the further lakes. On the 13th of September
Rogers embarked at Montreal with two hundred of
his men: he made his way up the St. Lawrence, and
coasted the northern shore of Lake Ontario, noting, as he
went, that Toronto, where the French had held Fort
Rouillé, was ‘a most convenient place for a factory, and
that from thence we may very easily settle the north side
of Lake Erie’.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> He crossed the upper end of Lake
Ontario to Fort Niagara, already in British possession;
and, having taken up supplies, carried his whale boats
round the falls and launched them on Lake Erie. Along
the southern side of that lake he went forward to Presque
Isle, where Bouquet was in command of the English garrison;
and, leaving his men, he went himself down by Fort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
le Bœuf, the French Creek river, and Venango to Fort
Pitt, or Pittsburg, as Fort Duquesne had been renamed
by John Forbes in honour of Chatham. His instructions
were to carry dispatches to General Monckton at Pittsburg,
and to take orders from him for a further advance.
Returning to Presque Isle at the end of October, he went
westward along Lake Erie, making for Detroit. No
English force had yet been in evidence so far to the West.
On the 7th of November he encamped on the southern
shore of Lake Erie, at a point near the site of the present
city of Cleveland, and there he was met by a party of
Ottawa Indians ‘just arrived from Detroit’.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">His
meeting
with
Pontiac.</div>

<p>They came, as Rogers tells us in another book,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> on an
embassy from Pontiac, and were immediately followed by
that chief himself. Pontiac’s personality seems to have
impressed the white backwoodsman, though he had seen
and known all sorts and conditions of North American
Indians. ‘I had several conferences with him,’ he writes,
‘in which he discovered great strength of judgement and
a thirst after knowledge.’ Pontiac took up the position
of being ‘King and Lord of the country’, and challenged
Rogers and his men as intruders into his land; but he
intimated that he would be prepared to live peaceably
with the English, as a subordinate not a conquered potentate;
and the result of the meeting was that the Rangers
were supplied with fresh provisions and were escorted
in safety on their way, instead of being obstructed and
attacked, as had been contemplated, at the entrance of
the Detroit river. On the 12th of November Rogers set
out again; on the 19th he sent on an officer in advance
with a letter to Belêtre, the French commander at Detroit,
informing him of the capitulation of Montreal and calling <span class="sidenote">Surrender of Detroit to the English.</span>
upon him to deliver up the fort. On the 29th of November
the English force landed half a mile below the fort, and
on the same day the French garrison laid down their arms.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Seven hundred Indians were present; and, when they
saw the French colours hauled down and the English
flag take their place, unstable as water and ever siding at the
moment with the stronger party, they shouted that ‘they
would always for the future fight for a nation thus favoured
by Him that made the world’.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Detroit.</div>

<p>There were at the time, Rogers tells us,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> about 2,500
French Canadians settled in the neighbourhood of Detroit.
The dwelling-houses, near 300 in number, extended on
both sides of the river for about eight miles. The land
was good for grazing and for agriculture, and there was
a ‘very large and lucrative’ trade with the Indians.</p>

<p>Having sent the French garrison down to Philadelphia,
and established an English garrison in its place, Rogers
sent a small party to take over Fort Miami on the Maumee
river, and set out himself with another detachment for
Michillimackinac. But it was now the middle of December; <span class="sidenote">Return of Rogers.</span>
floating ice made navigation of Lake Huron dangerous;
after a vain attempt to reach Michillimackinac he
returned to Detroit on the 21st of December; and,
marching overland to the Ohio and to Philadelphia, he <span class="sidenote">Michillimackinac occupied by the English.</span>
finally reached New York on the 14th of February, 1761.
In the autumn of that year a detachment of Royal
Americans took possession of Michillimackinac.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian
discontent.</div>

<p>Throughout 1761 and 1762 the discontent of the Indians
increased; they saw the English officers and soldiers in
their midst in strength and pride; they listened to the
tales of the French voyageurs; they remembered French
friendship and address, and contrasted it with the grasping
rudeness of the English trader or colonist; a native prophet
rose up to call the red men back to savagery, as the
one road to salvation; and influenced at once by superstition
and by the present fear of losing their lands, the
tribes of the West made ready to fight.</p>

<p>For months the call to war had secretly been passing
from tribe to tribe, and from village to village; and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the 27th of April, 1763, Pontiac held a council of Indians
at the little river Ecorces some miles to the south of <span class="sidenote">The fort at Detroit.</span>
Detroit, at which it was determined to attack the fort.
Fort Detroit stood on the western side of the Detroit
river, which runs from Lake St. Clair to Lake Erie, at
about five miles distance from the former lake and a little
over twenty miles from Lake Erie. The river is at its
narrowest point more than half a mile wide, and, as already
stated, Canadian settlement fringed both banks. The
fort, which stood a little back from the bank of the river,
consisted of a square enclosure surrounded by a wooden
palisade, with bastions and block-houses also of wood,
and within the palisade was a small town with barracks,
council house, and church. The garrison consisted of
about 120 soldiers belonging to the 39th Regiment; and,
in addition to the ordinary Canadian residents within the
town, there were some 40 fur-traders present at the
time, most of whom were French. The commander was <span class="sidenote">Major Gladwin.</span>
a determined man, Major Gladwin, who, under Braddock
on the Monongahela river, had seen the worst of Indian
fighting. Before April ended Gladwin reported to Amherst
that there was danger of an Indian outbreak;
and, when the crisis came, warned either by Indians or by
Canadians, he was prepared for it. For some, at any
rate, of the Canadians at Detroit, though they had no
love for the English, and though Pontiac was moving in
the name of the French king, were men of substance and
had something to lose. They were therefore not inclined
to side with the red men against the white, or
to lend themselves to extermination of the English
garrison.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pontiac’s
attempt
to surprise
the
garrison.</div>

<p>On the 1st of May Pontiac and forty of his men came
into the fort on an outwardly friendly visit, and took stock
of the ways of attack and the means of defence. Then
a few days passed in preparing for the blow. A party of
60 warriors were once more to gain admittance, hiding
under their blankets guns whose barrels had been filed
down for the purpose of concealment: they were to hold<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
a council with the English officers, and at a given signal to
shoot them down. The 7th of May was the day fixed for
the deed, but Gladwin was forewarned and forearmed.
The Indian chiefs were admitted to the fort, and attended
the council; but they found the garrison under arms,
and their plot discovered. Both sides dissembled, and
the Indians were allowed to leave, disconcerted, but
saved for further mischief. On the 9th of May they again
applied to be admitted to the fort, but this time were
refused, and open warfare began. Two or three English, <span class="sidenote">The fort openly attacked.</span>
who were outside the palisade at the time, were murdered,
and on the 10th, for six hours, the savages attacked the
fort with no success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Siege of
Detroit.</div>

<p>There was little danger that Detroit would be taken
by assault, but there was danger of the garrison being
starved out. Gladwin, therefore, tried negotiation with
Pontiac, and using French Canadians as intermediaries,
sent two English officers with them to the Indian camp.
The two Englishmen, one of them Captain Campbell, an
old officer of high character and repute, were kept as
captives, and Campbell was subsequently murdered.
The surrender of the fort was then demanded by Pontiac,
a demand which was at once refused; and against the
wishes of his officers Gladwin determined to hold the post
at all costs. Supplies were brought in by night by friendly
Canadians, and all immediate danger of starvation passed
away.</p>

<p>Amherst, the commander-in-chief, far away at New
York, had not yet learnt of the peril of Detroit or of the
nature and extent of the Indian rising, but in the ordinary
course in the month of May supplies were being sent up
for the western garrisons. The convoy intended for <span class="sidenote">British convoy cut off.</span>
Detroit left Niagara on the 13th of that month, in charge
of Lieutenant Cuyler with 96 men. Coasting along the
northern shore of Lake Erie, Cuyler, towards the end of
the month, reached a point near the outlet of the Detroit
river, and there drew up his boats on the shore. Before
an encampment could be formed the Indians broke in upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
the English, who fled panic-stricken to the boats; only
two boats escaped, and between 50 and 60 men out of the
total number of 96 were killed or taken. The survivors,
Cuyler himself among them, made their way across the
lake to Fort Sandusky, only to find that it had been burnt
to the ground, thence to Presque Isle, which was shortly
to share the fate of Sandusky, and eventually to Niagara.
The prisoners were carried off by their Indian captors,
up the Detroit river; two escaped to the fort to tell the
tale of disaster, but the majority were butchered with all
the nameless tortures which North American savages could
devise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Destruction
of
the
Western
outposts
by the
Indians.</div>

<p>While Detroit was being besieged, at other points in the
West one disaster followed another. Isolated from each
other, weakly garrisoned, commanded, in some instances,
by officers of insufficient experience or wanting in determination,
the forts fell fast. On the 16th of May Sandusky
was blotted out; on the 25th Fort St. Joseph, at
the south-eastern end of Lake Michigan, was taken; and
on the 27th Fort Miami, on the Maumee river. Fort
Ouatanon on the Wabash was taken on the 1st of June;
and on the 4th of that month the Ojibwa Indians overpowered <span class="sidenote">They take Michillimackinac.</span>
the garrison of Michillimackinac, second in
importance to Detroit. Captain Etherington, the commander
at Michillimackinac, knew nothing of what was
passing elsewhere, though he had been warned of coming
danger, and he lost the fort through an Indian stratagem.
The English were invited outside the palisades to see an
Indian game of ball; and, while the onlookers were off
their guard, and the gates of the fort stood open, the
players turned into warriors; some of the garrison and
of the English traders were murdered, and the rest were
made prisoners. The massacre, however, was not wholesale.
Native jealousy gave protectors to the English
survivors in a tribe of Ottawas who dwelt near: a French
Jesuit priest used every effort to save their lives; and
eventually the survivors, among whom was Etherington,
were, with the garrison of a neighbouring and subordinate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
post at Green Bay, sent down in safety to Montreal by
the route of the Ottawa river.</p>

<p>Next came the turn of the forts which connected Lake
Erie with the Ohio. On the 15th of June Presque Isle
was attacked; on the 17th it surrendered. It was a
strong fort, and in the opinion of Bouquet—a competent
judge—its commander, Ensign Christie, showed little
stubbornness in defence. Fort le Bœuf fell on the 18th,
Venango about the same date, and communication between <span class="sidenote">Fort Pitt isolated.</span>
the lakes and Fort Pitt was thus cut off. Fort Pitt itself
was threatened by the Indians, and towards the end of
July openly attacked, while on Forbes’ and Bouquet’s
old route from that fort to Bedford in Pennsylvania, Fort
Ligonier was also at an earlier date assailed, though
fortunately without success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dalyell
sent to
the
relief of
Detroit.</div>

<p>Amherst now realized the gravity of the crisis, and his
first care was the relief of Detroit. A force of 280 men,
commanded by Captain Dalyell, one of his aides de camp,
and including Robert Rogers with 20 Rangers, was sent
up from Niagara, ascended on the 29th of July the Detroit
river by night, and reached the fort in safety. Long
experience in North American warfare had taught the
lesson which Wolfe always preached, that the English
should, whenever and wherever it was possible, take the
offensive. Accordingly Dalyell urged Gladwin, against
the latter’s better judgement, to allow him to attack
Pontiac at once; and before daybreak, on the morning
of the 31st, he led out about 250 men for the purpose.
Less than two miles north-east of the fort, a little stream, <span class="sidenote">The fight at Parents Creek.</span>
then known as Parents Creek and after the fight as Bloody
Run, ran into the main river; and beyond it was Pontiac’s
encampment, which Dalyell proposed to surprise. Unfortunately
the Indians were fully informed of the intended
movement, and there ensued one more of the many disasters
which marked the onward path of the white men in North
America. The night was dark: the English advance took
them among enclosures and farm buildings, which gave
the Indians cover. As the leading soldiers were crossing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
the creek they were attacked by invisible foes; and, when
compelled to retreat, the force was beset on all sides and
ran the risk of being cut off from the fort. <span class="sidenote">Death of Dalyell.</span> Dalyell<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> was
shot dead; and, before the fort was reached, the English
had lost one-fourth of their whole number in killed and
wounded. The survivors owed their safety to the steadiness
of the officers, to the fact that Rogers and his men
seized and held a farmhouse to cover the retreat, and to
the co-operation of two armed boats, which moved up
and down the river parallel to the advance and retreat,
bringing off the dead and wounded, and pouring a fire
from the flank among the Indians.</p>

<p>Pontiac had achieved a notable success, but Detroit
remained safe, and meanwhile in another quarter the tide
set against the Indian cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fort Pitt.</div>

<p>After General Forbes, in the late autumn of 1758, had
taken Fort Duquesne, a new English fort, Fort Pitt, was
in the following year built by General Stanwix upon the
site of the French stronghold. The place was, as it had
always been, the key of the Ohio valley, and on the maintenance
of the fort depended at once the safety of the
borderlands of Virginia and Pennsylvania, and the possibility
of extending trade among the Indian tribes of the
Ohio. In July, 1763, Fort Pitt was in a critical position.
The posts which connected it with Lake Erie had been
destroyed: the road which Forbes had cut through
Pennsylvania on his memorable march was obstructed
by Indians; and the outlying post along it, Fort Ligonier,
about fifty-five miles east of Fort Pitt, was, like Fort Pitt
itself, in a state of siege. The Indians were, as in the dark
days after Braddock’s disaster, harrying the outlying
homesteads and settlements, and once more the colonies
were exhibiting to the full their incapacity for self-defence,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
or rather, the indifference of the residents in the
towns to the safety of their fellows who lived in the
backwoods.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
route to
Fort Pitt.</div>

<p>Forbes’ road to Fort Pitt ran for nearly 100 miles from
Bedford or Raestown, as it had earlier been called, in a
direction rather north of west, across the Alleghany
Mountains and the Laurel Hills. The intermediate post,
Fort Ligonier, stood at a place which had been known in
Forbes’ time as Loyalhannon, rather nearer to Bedford
than to Fort Pitt. Bedford itself was about thirty miles
north of Fort Cumberland on Wills Creek, which Braddock
had selected for the starting-point of his more southerly
march. It marked the limit of settlement, and 100
miles separated it from the town of Carlisle, which lay
due east, in the direction of the long-settled parts of
Pennsylvania.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Insecurity
of the
frontier.</div>

<p>There was no security in the year 1763 for the dwellers
between Bedford and Carlisle: ‘Every tree is become an
Indian for the terrified inhabitants,’ wrote Bouquet to
Amherst from Carlisle on the 29th of June.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Pennsylvania
<span class="sidenote">Difficulties with the Pennsylvanian legislature.</span>
raised 700 men to protect the farmers while gathering
their harvest, but no representations of Amherst would
induce the cross-grained Legislature to place them under
his command, to allow them to be used for offensive purposes,
or even for garrison duty. The very few regular
troops in the country were therefore required to hold the
forts, as well as to carry out any expedition which the
commander-in-chief might think necessary. A letter from
one of Amherst’s officers, Colonel Robertson, written to
Bouquet on the 19th of April, 1763, relates how all the
arguments addressed to the Quaker-ridden government
had been in vain, concluding with the words ‘I never saw
any man so determined in the right as these people are
in their absurdly wrong resolve’;[11] and in his answer
Bouquet speaks bitterly of being ‘utterly abandoned by
the very people I am ordered to protect’.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Henry
Bouquet.</div>

<p>Henry Bouquet had reason to be bitter. He had rendered
invaluable service to Pennsylvania and Virginia,
when under Forbes he had driven the French from the
Ohio valley. The colonies concerned had been backward
then, they were now more wrong-headed than ever, and
this at a time when the English army in America was sadly
attenuated in numbers. All depended upon one or two
men, principally upon Bouquet himself. Born in Canton
Berne, he was one of the Swiss officers who were given
commissions in the Royal American Regiment, the ancestors
of the King’s Royal Rifles, another being Captain
Ecuyer, who was at this time commander at Fort Pitt.
Bouquet was now in his forty-fourth year, a resolute, high-minded
man, a tried soldier, and second to none in knowledge
of American border fighting. In the spring of 1763 he
was at Philadelphia, when Amherst, still holding supreme
command in North America, ordered him to march to the
relief of Fort Pitt, while Dalyell was sent along the lakes
to bring succour to Detroit. At the end of June Bouquet
was at Carlisle, collecting troops, transport, and provisions
for his expedition; on the 3rd of July he heard the bad
news of the loss of the forts at Presque Isle, Le Bœuf, and
Venango; on the 25th of July he reached Bedford.</p>

<div class="sidenote">He
marches
to the
relief of
Fort Pitt.</div>

<p>He had a difficult and dangerous task before him.
The rough road through the forest and over the mountains
had been broken up by bad weather in the previous winter,
and the temporary bridges had been swept away. His
fighting men did not exceed 500, Highlanders of the 42nd
and 77th Regiments, and Royal Americans. The force
was far too small for the enterprise, and the commander
wrote of the disadvantage which he suffered from want
of men used to the woods, noting that the Highlanders
invariably lost themselves when employed as scouts, and
that he was therefore compelled to try and secure 30
woodsmen for scouting purposes.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>On the 2nd of August he reached Fort Ligonier, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
there, as on the former expedition, he left his heavy transport,
moving forward on the 4th with his little army on a
march of over fifty miles to Fort Pitt. On that day he advanced
twelve miles. On the 5th of August he intended to <span class="sidenote">The fight at Edgehill.</span>
reach a stream known as Bushy Creek or Bushy Run,
nineteen miles distant. Seventeen miles had been passed
by midday in the hot summer weather, when at one
o’clock, at a place which in his dispatch he called Edgehill,
the advanced guard was attacked by Indians. The
attack increased in severity, the flanks of the force and the
convoy in the rear were threatened, the troops were
drawn back to protect the convoy, and circling round it
they held the enemy at bay till nightfall, when they were
forced to encamp where they stood, having lost 60
men in killed and wounded, and, worst of all, being in
total want of water. Bravely Bouquet wrote to Amherst
that night, but the terms of the dispatch told his anxiety
for the morrow. At daybreak the Indians fell again upon
the wearied, thirsty ring of troops: for some hours the
fight went on, and a repetition of Braddock’s overthrow
seemed inevitable. At length Bouquet tried a stratagem.
Drawing back the two front companies of the circle, he
pretended to cover their retreat with a scanty line, and
lured the Indians on in mass, impatient of victorious
butchery. Just as they were breaking the circle, the men
who had been brought back and had unperceived crept
round in the woods, gave a point blank fire at close quarters
into the yelling crowd, and followed it with the
bayonet. Falling back, the Indians came under similar
fire and a similar charge from two other companies who
waited them in ambush, and leaving the ground strewn
with corpses the red men broke and fled. Litters were
then made for the wounded: such provisions as could
not be carried were destroyed; and at length the sorely
tried English reached the stream of Bushy Run. Even
there the enemy attempted to molest them, but were
easily dispersed by the light infantry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Victory
of the
English
and
relief of
Fort Pitt.</div>

<p>The victory had been won, but hardly won. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
casualties in the two days’ fighting numbered 115. That
the whole force was not exterminated was due to the
extraordinary steadiness of the troops, notably the Highlanders,
and to the resolute self-possession of their leader.
‘Never found my head so clear as that day,’ wrote Bouquet
to a friend some weeks later, ‘and such ready and cheerful
compliance to all the necessary orders.’<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> On the 10th
of August the expedition reached Fort Pitt without
further fighting, and relieved the garrison, whose defence
of the post had merited the efforts made for their
rescue.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of
Bouquet’s
victory.</div>

<p>Bouquet’s battles at Edgehill were small in the
number of troops employed, and were fought far away in
the American backwoods. They attracted little notice
in England—to judge from Horace Walpole’s contemptuous
reference to ‘half a dozen battles in miniature with
the Indians in America’;<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> but none the less they were of
vital importance. Attacking with every advantage on
their side, with superiority of numbers, in summer heat,
among their own woods, the Indians had been signally
defeated, and among the dead were some of their best
fighting chiefs. In Bouquet’s words, ‘the most warlike
of the savage tribes have lost their boasted claim of being
invincible in the woods;’<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and he continued to urge the
necessity of reinforcements in order to follow up the blow
and carry the warfare into the enemy’s country. But
the colonies did not answer, the war dragged on, and at the
beginning of October Bouquet had the mortification of
hearing of a British reverse at Niagara.</p>

<div class="sidenote">British
reverse at
Niagara.</div>

<p>The date was the 14th of September, and the Indians
concerned were the Senecas, who alone among the Six<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Nations took part in Pontiac’s rising. A small escort
convoying empty wagons from the landing above the
falls to the fort below was attacked and cut off; and
two companies sent to their rescue from the lower landing
were ambushed at the same spot, the ‘Devil’s Hole’,
where the path ran by the precipice below the falls.
Over 80 men were killed, including all the officers,
and 20 men alone remained unhurt. Nor was this
the end of disasters on the lakes. In November a strong
force from Niagara, destined for Detroit, started along
Lake Erie in a fleet of boats; a storm came on: the fleet
was wrecked: many lives were lost: and the shattered
remnant gave up the expedition and returned to Niagara.
Detroit, however, was now safe. When October came, <span class="sidenote">Ending of the siege of Detroit.</span>
various causes induced the Indians to desist from the
siege. The approach of winter warned them to scatter
in search of food: the news of Bouquet’s victory had due
effect, and so had information of the coming expedition
from Niagara, which had not yet miscarried. Most of all,
Pontiac learnt by letter from the French commander at
Fort Chartres that no help could be expected from France.
Accordingly, in the middle of October, Pontiac’s allies
made a truce with Gladwin, which enabled the latter to
replenish his slender stock of supplies; at the end of the
month Pontiac himself made overtures of peace: and the
month of November found the long-beleaguered fort comparatively
free of foes. In that same month Amherst <span class="sidenote">Amherst succeeded by Gage.</span>
returned to England, being succeeded as commander-in-chief
by General Gage, who had been Governor of
Montreal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Plan of
campaign
for 1764.</div>

<p>Before Amherst left he had planned a campaign for the
coming year. Colonel Bradstreet was to take a strong
force along the line of the lakes, and harry the recalcitrant
Indians to the south and west of that route, as far as they
could be reached, while Bouquet was to advance from Fort
Pitt into the centre of the Ohio valley, and bring to terms
the Delawares and kindred tribes, who had infested the
borders of the southern colonies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bradstreet.</div>

<p>Colonel John Bradstreet had gained high repute by his
well-conceived and well-executed capture of Fort Frontenac
in the year 1758— which earned warm commendation
from Wolfe. He was regarded as among the
best of the colonial officers, and as well fitted to carry war
actively and aggressively into the enemy’s country. In
this he conspicuously failed: he proved himself to be a
vain and headstrong man, and was found wanting when
left to act far from head quarters upon his own responsibility.
In June, 1764, he started from Albany, and made
his way by the old route of the Mohawk river and Oswego
to Fort Niagara, encamping at Niagara in July. His force
seems to have eventually numbered nearly 2,000 men,
one half of whom consisted of levies from New York and
New England, in addition to 300 Canadians. The latter
were included in the expedition in order to disabuse
the minds of the Indians of any idea that they were
being supported by the French population of North
America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Indian
conference
at
Niagara.</div>

<p>Before the troops left Niagara, a great conference of
Indians was held there by Sir William Johnson, who
arrived early in July. From all parts they came, except
Pontiac’s own following and the Delawares and Shawanoes
of the Ohio valley. Even the Senecas were induced by
threats to make an appearance, delivered up a handful of
prisoners, bound themselves over to keep peace with the
English in future, and ceded in perpetuity to the Crown
a strip of land four miles wide on both sides of the Niagara
river. About a month passed in councils and speeches;
on the 6th of August Johnson went back to Oswego, and
on the 8th Bradstreet went on his way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bradstreet’s
abortive
expedition.</div>

<p>His instructions were explicit, to advance into the
Indian territory, and, co-operating with Bouquet’s movements,
to reduce the tribes to submission by presence in
force. Those instructions he did not carry out. Near
Presque Isle, on the 12th of August, he was met by
Indians who purported to be delegates from the Delawares
and Shawanoes: and, accepting their assurances, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
engaged not to attack them for twenty-five days when,
on his return from Detroit, they were to meet him at
Sandusky, hand over prisoners, and conclude a final peace.
He went on to Sandusky a few days later, where messengers
of the Wyandots met him with similar protestations,
and were bidden to follow him to Detroit, and there make
a treaty. He then embarked for Detroit, leaving the
hostile tribes unmolested and his work unaccomplished.
From Sandusky he had sent an officer, Captain Morris,
with orders to ascend the Maumee river to Fort Miami, no
longer garrisoned, and thence to pass on to the Illinois
country. Morris started on his mission, came across
Pontiac on the Maumee, found war not peace, and, barely
escaping with his life, reached Detroit on the 17th of
September, when Bradstreet had already come and
gone.</p>

<p>Towards the end of August Bradstreet reached Detroit.
He held a council of Indians, at which the Sandusky
Wyandots were present, and, having proclaimed in some
sort British supremacy, thought he had put an end to the
war. The substantive effect of his expedition was that
he released Gladwin and his men, placing a new garrison in
the fort, and sent a detachment to re-occupy the posts at
Michillimackinac, Green Bay, and Sault St. Marie. He
then retraced his steps to Sandusky. Here the Delawares,
with whom he had made a provisional treaty at Presque
Isle, were to meet him and complete their submission;
and here he realized that Indian diplomacy had been
cleverer than his own. Only a few emissaries came to
the meeting-place with excuses for further delay, and
meanwhile he received a message from General Gage
strongly disapproving his action and ordering an immediate
advance against the tribes, whom he had represented
as brought to submission. He made no advance, loitered
a while where he was, and finally came back to Niagara at
the beginning of November after a disastrous storm on
Lake Erie, a discredited commander, with a disappointed
following.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span></p>

<p>If Bradstreet had any excuse for failure, it was that he
did not know the temper of the Western Indians, and
had not before his eyes perpetual evidence of their ferocity
and their guile. Bouquet knew them well, and great was
his indignation at the other commander’s ignorance or
folly. After the relief of Fort Pitt in the preceding <span class="sidenote">Bouquet’s operations.</span>
autumn he had gone back to Philadelphia, and throughout
the spring and summer of 1764 was busy with preparations
for a new campaign. On the 18th of September he was
back at Fort Pitt, ready for a westward advance, with
a strong force suitable for the work which lay before him.
He had with him 500 regulars, mostly the seasoned men
who had fought at Edgehill. Pennsylvania, roused at
last to the necessity of vigorous action, had sent 1,000
men to join the expedition; and, though of these last
a considerable number deserted on the route to Fort Pitt,
700 remained and were supplemented by over 200 Virginians.
In the first days of October the advance from
Fort Pitt began, the troops crossed the Ohio, followed
its banks in a north-westerly direction to the Beaver
Creek, crossed that river, and, marching westward through
the forests, reached in the middle of the month the valley
of the Muskingum river, near a deserted Indian village
known as Tuscarawa or Tuscaroras. Bouquet was now
within striking distance of the Delawares and the other
Indian tribes who had so long terrorized the borderlands
of the southern colonies. Near Tuscarawa Indian deputies
met him, and were ordered—as a preliminary to peace—to
deliver up within twelve days all the prisoners in their
hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Submission
of the
Western
Indians.</div>

<p>The spot fixed for the purpose was the junction of the
two main branches of the Muskingum, forty miles distant
to the south-west, forty miles nearer the centre of the
Indians’ homes. To that place the troops marched on,
strong in their own efficiency and in the personality of
their leader, although news had come that Bradstreet,
who was to threaten the Indians from Sandusky, was
retreating homewards to Niagara. At the Forks of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
Muskingum an encampment was made, and there at
length, at the beginning of November, the red men brought
back their captives. The work was fully done: north to
Sandusky, and to the Shawano villages far to the west,
Bouquet’s messengers were sent; the Indians saw the
white men in their midst ready to strike hard, and they
accepted the inevitable. The tribes which could not
at the time make full restoration gave hostages of their
chiefs, and hostages too were taken for the future consummation
of peace, the exact terms of which were left
to be decided and were shortly after arranged by Sir
William Johnson. With these pledges of obedience, and
with the restored captives, Bouquet retraced his steps,
and reached Fort Pitt again on the 28th of November.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bouquet’s
success.</div>

<p>He had achieved a great victory, bloodless but complete;
and at length the colonies realized what he had done.
A vote of thanks to him was passed by the Pennsylvanian
Assembly in no grudging terms. The Virginians, too,
thanked him, but with rare meanness tried to burden him
with the pay of the Virginian volunteers, who had served
in the late expedition. This charge Pennsylvania took
upon itself, more liberal than the sister colony; and the
Imperial Government showed itself not unmindful of
services rendered, for, foreigner as he was, Bouquet was
promoted to be a brigadier-general in the British army.
He was appointed to command the troops in Florida, and <span class="sidenote">His death.</span>
died at Pensacola in September, 1765, leaving behind him
the memory of a most competent soldier, and a loyal,
honourable man.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Illinois
country
and the
Mississippi.</div>

<p>Beyond the scene of Bouquet’s operations—further still
to the west—lay the Illinois country and the settlements
on the eastern bank of the Mississippi. Ceded to Great
Britain by the Treaty of 1763, they were still without
visible sign of British sovereignty; and, when the year
1764 closed, Pontiac’s name and influence was all
powerful among the Indians of these regions, while the
French flag still flew at Fort Chartres. By the treaty,
the navigation of the Mississippi was left open to both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
French and English; and in the spring of 1764 an English
officer from Florida had been dispatched to ascend the
river from New Orleans, and take over the ceded forts.
The officer in question—Major Loftus—started towards
the end of February, and, after making his way for some
distance up-stream, was attacked by Indians and forced
to retrace his steps. Whether or not the attack was
instigated by the French, it is certain that Loftus received
little help or encouragement from the French commander
at New Orleans, and it is equally certain that trading
jealousy threw every obstacle in the way of the English
advance into the Mississippi valley. It was not until the <span class="sidenote">British occupation of Fort Chartres.</span>
autumn of 1765 that 100 Highlanders of the 42nd Regiment
made their way safely down the Ohio, and finally
took Fort Chartres into British keeping.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Croghan’s
mission.</div>

<p>The way had been opened earlier in the year by Croghan,
one of Sir William Johnson’s officers, who in the summer
months went westward down the Ohio to remind the tribes
of the pledges given to Bouquet, and to quicken their
fulfilment. He reached the confluence of the Wabash
river, and a few miles lower down was attacked by a band
of savages, who afterwards veered round to peace and
conducted him, half guest, half prisoner, to Vincennes and
Ouatanon, the posts on the Wabash. Near Ouatanon he
met Pontiac, was followed by him to Detroit, where it was
arranged that a final meeting to conclude a final peace
should be held at Oswego in the coming year. The
meeting took place in July, 1766, under the unrivalled
guidance of Sir William Johnson, and with it came the end
of the Indian war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of
the
Indian
war and
death of
Pontiac.</div>

<p>The one hope for the confederate Indians had been help
from the French. Slowly and reluctantly they had been
driven to the conclusion that such help would not be
forthcoming, and that for France the sun had set in the
far west of North America. Pontiac himself gave in his
submission to the English; he took their King for his
father, and, when he was killed in an Indian brawl on the
Mississippi in 1769, the red men’s vision of independence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
or of sovereignty in their native backwoods faded away.
The two leading white races in North America, French and
English, had fought it out; there followed the Indian
rising against the victors; and soon was to come the
almost equally inevitable struggle between the British
colonists, set free from dread of Frenchman or of Indian,
and the dominating motherland of their race.</p>

<span class="fs80">CAUSES OF THE AMERICAN WAR OF INDEPENDENCE
AND THE QUEBEC ACT</span></h2>

<p>It was said of the Spartans that warring was their
salvation and ruling was their ruin. The saying holds
true of various peoples and races in history. A militant
race has often proved to be deficient in the qualities which
ensure stable, just, and permanent government; and in
such cases, when peace supervenes on war, an era of
decline and fall begins for those whom fighting has made
great. But even when a conquering race has capacity
for government, there come times in its career when
Aristotle’s dictum in part holds good. It applied, to some
extent, to the English in North America. As long as they
were faced by the French on the western continent,
common danger and common effort held the mother
country and the colonies together. Security against a
foreign foe brought difficulties which ended in civil war,
and the Peace of 1763 was the beginning of dissolution.</p>

<p>In the present chapter, which covers the history of
Canada from the Peace of Paris to the outbreak of the
War of Independence, it is proposed, from the point of
view of colonization, to examine the ultimate rather than
the immediate causes which led to England losing her
old North American colonies, while she retained her new
possession of Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Prophecies
that the
British
conquest
of Canada
would be
followed
by the
loss of the
North
American
colonies.
Peter
Kalm.</div>

<p>It had been abundantly prophesied that the outcome
of British conquest of Canada would be colonial independence
in British North America. In the years 1748-50
the Swedish naturalist, Peter Kalm, travelled through the
British North American colonies and Canada, and left
on record his impressions of the feeling towards the
mother country which existed at the time in the British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
provinces. Noting the great increase in these colonies of
riches and population, and the growing coolness towards
Great Britain, produced at once by commercial restrictions
and by the presence among the English colonists of
German, Dutch, and French settlers, he arrived at the
conclusion that the proximity of a rival and hostile power
in Canada was the main factor in keeping the British
colonies under the British Crown. ‘The English Government,’
he wrote, ‘has therefore sufficient reason to consider
the French in North America as the best means of
keeping the colonies in their due submission.’<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>Others wrote or spoke to the same effect. Montcalm
was credited with having prophesied the future before he
shared the fall of Canada,<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> and another prophet was the
French minister Choiseul, when negotiating the Peace of
Paris. To keen, though not always unprejudiced, observers
the signs of the times betokened coming conflicts between
Great Britain and her colonies; and to us now looking
back on history, wise after the event, it is evident that
the end of foreign war in North America meant the
beginning of troubles within what was then the circle of
the British Empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Incorrect
view of
the conflict
between
Great
Britain
and her
colonies
in North
America.</div>

<p>Until recent years most Englishmen were taught to
believe that the victory of the American colonists and the
defeat of the mother country was a striking instance of
the power of right over might, of liberty over oppression;
that the severance of the American colonies was a net
gain to them, and a net loss to England; that Englishmen
did right to stand in a white sheet when reflecting on these
times and events, as being citizens of a country which
grievously sinned and was as grievously punished. All
this was pure assumption. The war was one in which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
there were rights and wrongs on both sides, but, whereas
America had in George Washington a leader of the noblest
and most effective type, England was for the moment in
want both of statesmen and of generals, and had her
hands tied by foreign complications. We can recognize
that Providence shaped the ends, without going beyond
the limits of human common sense. Had Pitt been what he <span class="sidenote">Great Britain failed for want of leaders.</span>
was in the years preceding the Peace of Paris, had Wolfe
and the eldest of the brothers Howe not been cut off in early
manhood, the war might have been averted, or its issue
might have been other than it was. One of Wolfe’s best
subordinates, Carleton, survived, and Carleton saved
Canada; there was no human reason why men of the same
stamp, had they been found, should not have kept for
England her heritage. The main reason why she lost her
North American colonies was not the badness of her cause,
but rather want of the right men when the crisis came.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
result of
the War
of Independence
was not
wholly a
loss to
Great
Britain
nor
wholly
a gain
to the
United
States.</div>

<p>Equally fallacious with the view that England failed
because wrong-doing never prospers, is, or was, the view
that the independence of the United States was wholly
a loss to England and wholly a gain to the colonists.
What would have happened if the revolting provinces had
not made good their revolt must be matter of speculation,
but it is difficult to believe that, if the United States had
remained under the British flag, Australia would ever
have become a British colony. There is a limit to every
political system and every empire, and, with the whole
of North America east of the Mississippi for her own, it is
not likely that England would have taken in hand the
exploiting of a new continent. At any rate it is significant
that, within four years of the date of the treaty which
recognized the independence of the United States, the
first English colonists were sent to Australia. The
success or failure of a nation or a race in the field of
colonization must not be measured by the number of
square miles of the earth’s surface which the home government
owns or claims at any given time. To judge aright,
we must revert to the older and truer view of colonizing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
as a planting process, replenishing the earth and subduing
it. If the result of the severance of the United
States from their mother country was to sow the English
seed in other lands, then it may be argued that the defeat
of England by her own children was not wholly a loss to
the mother country.</p>

<p>Nor was it wholly a gain to the United States. Such
at least must be the view of Englishmen who believe in
the worth of their country, in its traditions, in the character
of the nation, in its political, social, moral, and religious
tendencies. The necessary result of the separation was to
alienate the American colonists from what was English; to
breed generations in the belief that what England did must
be wrong, that the enemies of England must be right; to
strengthen in English-speaking communities the elements
which were opposed to the land and to the race from which
they had sprung. With English errors and weaknesses
there passed away, in course of years and in some measure,
English sources of strength; the sober thinking, the slow
broadening out, the perpetually leavening sense of responsibility.
Had the American provinces remained under
the British flag it is difficult to see why they should not
have been in the essence as free and independent as they
now are; it is at least conceivable that their commercial
and industrial prosperity would have been as great;
assuredly, for good or for evil, they would have been
more English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shortcomings
of the
English
in foreign
and
colonial
policy.</div>

<p>The faults and shortcomings of the English, which
throughout English history have shown themselves mainly
in foreign and colonial matters, seem all to have combined
and culminated in the interval of twenty years between
the Peace of 1763, which gave Canada to Great Britain,
and the Peace of 1783, which took from her the United
States; and in addition there were special causes at work
in England, which at this more than at any other time
militated against national success.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
party
System.</div>

<p>The shortcomings in question are, in part, the result
of counterbalancing merits, fair-mindedness, and freedom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
of thought, speech, and action. Love of liberty among
the English has begotten an almost superstitious reverence
for Parliamentary institutions. Parliamentary institutions
have practically meant the House of Commons; and
the House of Commons has for many generations past
implied the party system. In regard to foreign and
colonial policy the party system has worked the very
serious evil that Great Britain has in the past rarely
spoken or acted as one nation. The party in power at
times of national crisis is constantly obliged to reckon on
opposition rather than support, from the large section of
Englishmen whose leaders are not in office; and ministers
have to frame not so much the most effective measures,
as those which can under the circumstances be carried
with least friction and delay. The result has been weakness
and compromise in action; among the friends of
England, suspicion and want of confidence; among her
foes, waiting on the event which prolongs the strife. The
English have so often gone forward and then back, they
have so often said one thing and done another, that their
own officers, their friends and allies, their native subjects,
and their open enemies, cannot be sure what will be the
next move. If the Opposition in Parliament and outside,
by speech and writing, attacks the Government, the
natural inference to be drawn is that a turn of the electoral
tide will reverse the policy.</p>

<p>Apart too from this more or less necessary result of
party government, the element of cross-grained men and
women, who, when their own country is at issue with
another, invariably think that their country must be
wrong and its opponent must be right, has always been
rather stronger, or, at any rate, rather more tolerated in
the United Kingdom than among continental nations.
This is due not merely to the habit of free criticism, but
also to a kind of conceit familiar enough in private as in
public life. Englishmen, living apart from the continent
of Europe, are, as a whole, more wrapped up in themselves
than are other nations; and in this self-satisfied whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
there is a proportion of superior persons who sit in judgement
on the rest, and who, having in reality a double dose
of the national Pharisaism, think it their duty to belittle
their countrymen.</p>

<p>Fault-finders of this kind, or political opponents of the
Government for the time being, are apt, as a rule, to make
light of any minority in the hostile or rival country, who
may be friendly to England: they tend to misrepresent
them as being untrue to their own land and people, as
wanting to domineer over the majority, as seeking their own
interests: and, if they have suffered losses for England’s
sake, the tale of the losses is minimized. But it is not only
the opponents of the Government who take this line; too
often in past history it has been to a large extent the line
of the Government itself. The perpetual seeking after
compromise, and trying to see two sides after the choice of
action has been made, has lost many friends to our country
and nation, and made none: while the retracing of steps,
unmindful of claims which have arisen, of property which
has been acquired, and of responsibilities which have
been incurred has, as the record of the past abundantly
shows, brought bitterness of spirit to the friends of
England, and bred distrust of the English and their
works.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Want of
preparation
for
war.</div>

<p>The element of uncertainty in British policy and action
towards foreign nations or towards British colonies has
been in part due to ignorance: and to ignorance and want
of preparation have been due most of the disasters in war
which have befallen Great Britain. Here again something
must be attributed to the fact of the island home.
The rulers of continental peoples have been driven by
the necessities of their case to learn the conditions of their
rivals, by secret service and intelligence agents to ascertain
all that is to be known, and at the same time to keep their
own arms up to date, and their own powder dry. They
have prepared for war. England has prepared for peace.
Her policy has paid in the long run, but it would not have
been a possible policy for other nations; and at certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
times in English history it has wrought terrible mischief.
England does not always muddle through, as the English
fondly hope she does; notably, she did not muddle
through when the United States proclaimed their independence.</p>

<p>In these years, 1763-83, there was the party system in
England with all its mischievous bitterness; there was a
weak Executive at home, and a still weaker Executive in
the colonies; there was ignorance of the real conditions
in America, unwise handling of the colonial Loyalists,
threatening talk coupled with vacillation in action, laws
made which gave offence, and, when they had given offence,
not quite repealed. All the normal English weaknesses
flourished and abounded at this period, and were supplemented
by certain sources of danger which were the
outcome of the particular time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Special
evils at
work in
England
in the
years
1763-83.</div>

<p>It was a special time, a time of reaction. England had
lately gone through a great struggle, made a great effort,
incurred great expense, and won great success. She was
for the moment vegetating, not inclined or ready for a <span class="sidenote">A time of reaction.</span>
second crisis. Second-rate politicians were handling
matters, and the influence of the new King was all in
favour of their being and remaining second-rate; for
George the Third intended, by meddling in party politics, <span class="sidenote">Partisan attitude of the Crown.</span>
and by Parliamentary intrigues, to rule Parliament. Thus
the Crown became a partisan in home politics, and in
colonial politics was placed in declared opposition to the
colonies, instead of remaining the great bond between
the colonies and the mother country.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sympathy
in
England
with the
colonists
and their
cause.</div>

<p>The result was, that throughout the years of the
American quarrel, and in a growing degree, the colonies
found powerful support in this country, because they
were, after all, not foreigners but Englishmen—Englishmen
who compared favourably with Englishmen at home
and whom patriotic Englishmen at home could admire
and uphold; because they were apparently the weaker
side, attracting the sympathy which in England the weaker
side always attracts; and because, through the attitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
of the King, their cause was associated with the cause of
political liberty at home. Add to this that the one great
English statesman of world-wide reputation, Chatham,
had warmly espoused the colonial side, and it may well be
seen that, unless some able general, as Wellington in later
days, by military success, saved his country from the
results of political blunders, the position was hopeless.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ultimate
causes
of the
severance
of the
North
American
colonies.</div>

<p>But for the special purpose of determining what place
the episode of the severance of the British North American
colonies holds in the history of colonization we must
look still further afield. The constitutional question as
to whether the colonies were subject to the Parliament
of the mother country or to the Crown alone may, from
this particular point of view, be omitted, for the story
of the troubled years abundantly shows that theories
would have slept, if certain practical difficulties had
not called them into waking existence, and if lawyers
had not been so much to the front, holding briefs on either
side. Nor is it necessary to dwell upon the specific and
immediate causes of the strife, except so far as they were
ultimate causes also. Among such immediate causes,
some of which have been already noted, were the personal
character of the English king for the time being, the corruption
and jobbery of public life in England, the weakness
of the Executive in the colonies, the enforcing of
commercial restrictions already placed by the mother
country on the colonies, the kind of new taxes which
the Home Government imposed, the method of imposing
them, and the object with which they were devised; the
outrageous laws of 1774 for penalizing Massachusetts, the
Quebec Act, and the employment of German mercenaries
against the colonists, which gave justification to the
colonists for calling in aid from France. All these and
other causes might have been powerless to affect the issue,
if England had possessed statesmen and generals, and
if the growing plant of disunion had not been deeply rooted
in the past.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparison
of
Spanish
and
British
colonization
in
America.</div>

<p>When France lost Canada and Louisiana, two European<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
nations, other than the Portuguese in Brazil, practically
shared the mainland of America. They were Spain and
Great Britain. Spain won her American empire not far
short of a hundred years before Great Britain had any
strong footing on the American continent; she kept it for <span class="sidenote">Spain held her American
possessions for a longer time than Great Britain held the North American colonies.</span>
some thirty or forty years after the United States had
achieved their independence. The Spanish-American
empire was therefore much longer-lived than the first
colonial dominion of Great Britain in North America,
and the natural inference is, either that the Spaniards
treated their colonies or dependencies better than the
English treated theirs, or that the English colonies were in
a better position than the Spanish dependencies to assert
their independence, or that both causes operated simultaneously.</p>

<p>It is difficult to compare Spain and Great Britain as
regards their respective colonial policies in America, for
their possessions differed in kind. Spain owned dependencies
rather than colonies, Great Britain owned colonies
rather than dependencies. Spanish America was the
result of conquest: English America, not including
Canada, was the result of settlement. But, so far as a
comparison can be instituted, it will probably not be
seriously contended that the British colonies suffered
more grievously at the hands of the mother country than
did the colonial possessions of Spain. The main charge
brought against England was that she neglected her
colonies and left them to themselves. Whether the
charge was true or not—as to which there is more to be
said—neglect is not oppression; and within limits the
kindest and wisest policy towards colonies, which are
colonies in the true sense, is to leave them alone.
‘The wise neglect of Walpole and Newcastle,’ writes
Mr. Lecky, ‘was eminently conducive to colonial interests.’<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>The real, ultimate reasons why England held her North<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
American colonies, which now form the United States
of America, for a shorter time than Spain retained her
Central and South American possessions were two: first, <span class="sidenote">Absence of system in British colonial policy in North America.</span>
that the English colonies were in a better position than
the Spanish dependencies to assert their independence;
secondly, that—largely because she owned dependencies
rather than colonies—Spain was more systematic than
England in her dealings with her colonial possessions.
These two reasons are in truth one and the same, looked
at from different sides. The English colonies were able to
assert their independence, because they had on the whole
always been more or less independent. They had always
been more or less independent, because the mother
country had never adopted any definite system of colonial
administration. The Spanish system was not good—quite
the contrary; but it was a system, and those who
lived under it were accustomed to restrictions and to rules
imposed by the home government. Similarly in Canada,
under French rule, there was a system, kindlier and better
than that of Spain, but one which had the gravest defects,
which stunted growth and precluded freedom: yet there
it was, clear and definite; the colonists of New France had
grown up under it; they knew where they were in relation
to the mother country; it had never occurred to them to
try and make headway against the King of France and
his regulations. Widely different was the case of the
English colonies in North America. All these settlements
started under some form of grant or charter, derived
ultimately from the Crown: the Crown from time to
time interfered and made a show of its supremacy; but
there was no system of any sort or kind, and communities
grew up, which in practice had never been governed from
home but governed themselves. Most of all, the New
England colonies embodied to the full the spirit of colonial
independence. Their founders, men of the strongest
English type, went out to live in their own way, to be
free from restrictions which trammelled them at home,
to found small English-speaking commonwealths which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
should be self-governing and self-supporting, ordered from
within, not from without.</p>

<div class="sidenote">When the
English
colonies
were
planted
in North
America
there was
the most
complete
absence
of system
at home.</div>

<p>The English have never been systematic or continuous
in their policy throughout their history; but the period
of English history when North America was colonized
was the one of all others when system and continuity
were most conspicuously absent. It was a time of violent
political changes at home, of strife between king and
people. A line of kings was brought in from Scotland,
they were overturned, they were restored, and they were
finally driven out again. This was the condition of the
Crown to which the newly-planted colonies owed allegiance,
and which was supposed to exercise supreme authority
over the colonies. Under the Crown were Proprietors and
Companies, whose charters, being derived from a perpetually
disputed source, were a series of dissolving views;
and under the Proprietors and Companies were a number
of strong English citizens who, caring little for the theoretical
basis of their position, cared very much for practical
independence, and ordered their ways accordingly, becoming
steadily and stubbornly more independent through
perpetual friction and perpetual absence of systematic
control. Thus it was that the North American colonies
drank in, as their mother’s milk, the traditions and the
habits of independence. They carried with them English
citizenship, but the privileges of such citizenship rather
than the responsibilities; and, in so far as the mother
country was inclined to ignore the privileges, the colonies
were glad to disclaim the responsibilities.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Absence
of collective
responsibility
in the
British
North
American
colonies.</div>

<p>They were separate and distinct, not only from the
mother country, but also from each other, and they could
not in consequence from first to last be held collectively
responsible. In the wars with Canada, New England
and New York, though alike exposed to French invasion,
and from time to time co-operating to repel the invaders
or to organize counter-raids, yet acted throughout as
entirely separate entities, in no way inclined to bear
each other’s burdens as common citizens of a common<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
country. The southern colonies, until the French,
shortly before the beginning of the Seven Years’ War,
came down into the valley of the Ohio, took no part whatever
in the fight between Great Britain and France for
North America. The New Englanders, most patriotic of
the colonists, beyond all others went their own ways in
war and peace; uninvited and unauthorized from home
they formed a confederation among themselves: early in
their history they tried to make a treaty with Canada on
the basis that, whatever might be the relations between
France and England in Europe, there should be peace
between French and English in North America: they
took Port Royal: they attacked Quebec: they captured
Louisbourg: and the anonymous French eye-witness of
the first siege and capture of Louisbourg commented as
follows on the difference between the colonial land forces
and the men of the small Imperial squadron which Warren
brought to the colonists’ aid: ‘In fact one could never
have told that these troops belonged to the same nation
and obeyed the same prince. Only the English are capable
of such oddities, which nevertheless form a part of
that precious liberty of which they show themselves so
jealous.’<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
colonies
had never
been
taxed for
revenue
purposes.</div>

<p>Most of all it should be remembered that, though subject
to the Navigation laws imposed by the mother country
and to that extent restricted in their commercial dealings,
no English colony in North America, before the days of the
Stamp Act, had ever been taxed by Crown or Parliament
for revenue purposes. In the year 1758 Montcalm was
supposed to have written on this subject in the following
terms: ‘As to the English colonies, one essential point
should be known, it is that they are never taxed. They
keep that to themselves, an enormous fault this in
the policy of the mother country. She should have
taxed them from the foundation. I have certain advice
that all the colonies would take fire at being taxed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
now.’<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> This judgement was probably sound. It might
have been well if from the first, when charters were
issued and colonial communities were formed, some small
tax had been levied for Imperial purposes upon the
British colonies, if some contribution of only nominal
amount had been exacted as a condition of retaining
British citizenship. There would then have been a precedent,
such as Englishmen always try to find, and
there would have been in existence a reminder that all
members of a family should contribute to the household
expenses.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
political
separation
of
the North
American
colonies
was the
natural
result of
their geographical
separation.</div>

<p>We are accustomed to think and to read of the separation
of the American colonies from the mother country as
wholly an abnormal incident, the result of bad handiwork,
not the outcome of natural forces. This view is incorrect.
History ultimately depends on geography. When two
members of the same race, nation, or family pass their
lives at a long distance from each other, in different lands,
in different climates, under different conditions, the
natural and inevitable result is that they diverge from
each other. The centrifugal tendency may be counteracted
by tact and clever statesmanship, and still more by sense
of common danger; but it is a natural tendency. Men
cannot live at a distance from each other without becoming
to some extent estranged. The Greeks, with their instinctive
love of logic and of symmetry, and with their fundamental
conception of a city as the political unit, looked
on colonization as separation, and called a colony a departure
from home. The colonists carried with them
reverence for the mother state, but not dependence upon
it; and, if there was any political bond, it was embodied
in the words that those who went out went out on terms<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
of equality with, not of subordination to, those who
remained behind. The English, in fact, though not in
principle, planted colonies on the model of the Greek
settlements; their theories and their practice collided;
and, being a practical race, their theories eventually went
by the board.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conflicting
tendencies.
Distance
and sentiment.</div>

<p>When an over-sea colony is founded, the new settlement
is in effect most distant from the old country; that
is to say, means of communication between the one point
and the other are least frequent and least developed.
The tendency to separation—as far as geography is concerned—is
therefore strongest at the outset. On the
other hand, in the foundation of a colony, unless the
foundation is due to political disruption at home, the sentiment
towards the mother country is warmer and closer than
in after years, for the founders remember where they were
born and where they grew to manhood. As generations go
on, the tie of sentiment becomes necessarily weaker, but,
with better communication, distance becomes less; there
is therefore a competition between the opposing tendencies.
Many of the Greek colonies were the result of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στάσις</span> <span class="sidenote"><span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">στάσις</span> and colonization.</span>
or division in the mother cities. The unsuccessful party
went out and made a separate home. In a very modified
form the same cause was at work in the founding of the
Puritan colonies of North America. Notably, the emigrants
on the <i>Mayflower</i> were already exiles from England,
political refugees, who had found a temporary home in
the Netherlands. These founders of the Plymouth settlement
were by no means the chief colonizers of North
America, or even of New England, but their story—the
story of the ‘Pilgrim fathers’—became a nucleus of
Puritan tradition; and from it after generations deduced
that New England was the home of English citizens whom
England had cast out. Thus one group, at any rate, of
North American colonies traced their origin to separation.
Then came the element of distance. ‘The European
colonies in America,’ wrote Adam Smith, with some
exaggeration, ‘are more remote than the most distant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
provinces of the greatest empires which had ever been
known before.’<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> The Atlantic Ocean lay between them
and the motherland, and cycles went by before that
distance was perceptibly modified. In our own time,
steam and telegraphy have been perpetually counteracting
the effects of distance. It was not so in the
seventeenth or eighteenth centuries. Navigation was
improved, but was still the humble handmaid of wind
and tide; and on the very eve of the American War of
Independence the remoteness of the North American
colonies, and the prevailing ignorance in England about
the North American colonies were, though no doubt
much exaggerated, a commonplace among the speakers
and writers of the time.</p>

<p>We start then with colonies planted from a land which
had no thought of systematic control over colonies or
dependencies, whose government was at the time of
colonization in a chaotic state, whose colonists went out
in part, at any rate, intent on practical separation, and
who all settled themselves or were settled in a remote
region at a time when distance did not grow less.</p>

<p>The next point to notice is that it has always been held
that, as between a mother country and its colonies, if they
are colonies in the true sense and not merely tributary
states, it is rather for the mother country to give and her
colonies to take, than vice versa. This is a view which has
been held at all times and among all races, but especially
among members of the English race. Other nations and <span class="sidenote">General view of the duty of a mother country towards its colonies.</span>
races have, it is true, felt as strongly as, or more strongly
than, the English the duty of protecting their outlying
possessions: they have in some cases lavished more
money directly upon them at the expense of the taxpayers
at home; but, on the other hand, they have almost
invariably regarded their colonies as dependencies pure
and simple, constrained to take the course of the dominant
partner in preference to their own. The English alone in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
history have bred communities protected by, but in practice
not subject to, the mother country. They have given,
without exacting toll in return.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adam
Smith
on the
subject.</div>

<p>No writer has laid greater stress on this view of the
relations between the mother country and the colonies
than Adam Smith, who published the <i>Wealth of Nations</i>
just as the American colonies were breaking away from
Great Britain. ‘The English colonists,’ he wrote, ‘have
never yet contributed anything towards the defence of the
mother country, or towards the support of its civil government.
They themselves, on the contrary, have hitherto
been defended almost entirely at the expense of the
mother country;’ and again, ‘Under the present system of
management, Great Britain derives nothing but loss from
the dominion which she has assumed over her colonies.’
‘Great Britain is, perhaps, since the world began, the
only state which, as it has extended its empire, has only
increased its expense without once augmenting its resources.’<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
His opinion would have been modified could
he have foreseen the help given to the mother country
in our own day by the self-governing colonies of Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand in a war far removed from their
shores; but even in our own day the old view, against
which he contended, largely holds the field, that more is
due from the mother country to the colonies than from
the colonies to the mother country, that what the mother
country spends on the Empire is payment of a debt, while
what the colonies spend on the Empire is a free gift.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
mother
country,
being
usually
greater
than the
colony, is
expected
to give
rather
than to
receive.</div>

<p>This view of the relations between a mother country
and its colonies takes its ultimate source largely from the
fact that the mother country is nearly always<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> greater
and stronger than any one colony or group of colonies;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
and in the English mind the instinct of fair play invariably
makes in favour of the party to a contract which is or
appears to be the weaker party. It is in the light of the
fact that the American colonies were numerically the
weaker party in their contention with the mother country,
and with the misleading deduction that any demand
made upon them was therefore unjust, that the story of
the War of Independence has over and over again been
wrongly told. In one of the more recent books on the
subject, Sir George Trevelyan’s <i>American Revolution</i>, it
is stated that all the colonies asked of the King was to
be let alone.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> That is all that any man or any community
asks, when called upon to pay a bill; and the question at
issue between the mother country and the colonies in the
eighteenth century was the eternal question, which vexes
every community and every federation of communities,
who ought to pay. The bill was one for defence purposes;
but, when it was presented, the colonists’ answer was in
effect, first, that it was the duty of the mother country to <span class="sidenote">Contentions of the colonists.</span>
defend the colonies; secondly, that that duty had been
neglected; and thirdly, that, assuming that it had been
performed, it was for the colonies and not for the mother
country to determine what proportion of the expense, if
any, should be defrayed by the colonies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(1) It was
the duty
of the
mother
country
to bear
the expense
of
defending
the
colonies.</div>

<p>The first of these three contentions may not have been
fully avowed, but deep down in the minds of men there
lay the conviction that the mother country ought to pay for
defending the colonies, and there it has remained, more or
less, ever since. It is true that the grant of self-government
in its fullest sense to the present great provinces of the
British Empire has been coupled with the withdrawal of the
regular forces from all but a few points of selected Imperial
vantage, and to that extent the colonies have taken up, <span class="sidenote">This view still prevails.</span>
and well taken up, the duty of self-defence; but the burden
of the fleet, the great defensive force of the Empire as
a whole, is still borne in the main, and was till recently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
entirely borne, by the mother country. When colonies
or foreign possessions are in a condition of complete
political dependence upon the mother country, it may
fairly be argued that the latter, in insisting upon dependence,
should, as the price of supremacy, undertake to
some extent the duty of defence. And yet a survey of
the British Empire at the present day shows that no self-governing
province of the Empire is so highly organized
or so fully charged for the purposes of defence as is
the great dependency of India.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Independence
implies
self-defence.</div>

<p>The first and most elementary duty of an independent
community, the one condition without which it cannot
be independent, is providing for its own defence. The
American colonies claimed in reality political independence,
at any rate as far as internal matters were concerned;
but they did not admit, except to a limited extent,
that it was their duty to provide against foreign invasion.
That duty, in their eyes, devolved upon the mother country
because it was the mother country; because it was
held that the mother country derived more advantage
from the colonies than—apart from defence—the colonies
derived from her; and because the mother country dictated
the foreign policy of the Empire; in common parlance,
it called the tune and therefore, it was argued,
should pay the piper.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The

on the

colonies.</div>

<p>The Navigation laws, the commercial restrictions imposed
by Great Britain on her colonies, were assumed
to represent the price which the colonies paid in return
for the protection which the mother country gave or
professed to give to the colonies; and these same laws
and restrictions, viewed in the light of later times, have
been held to be the burden of oppression which was
greater than the colonies could bear. Adam Smith, the
writer who most forcibly exposed the unsoundness of the
old mercantile system, also demonstrated most conclusively
that that system was universal in the eighteenth
century; that it was less oppressively applied by England
than by other countries which owned colonies; that under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
it, if the colonies were restricted in trade, they were also
in receipt of bounties; and lastly, that the undoubted
disadvantages which were the result of the system were
shared by the mother country with the colonies, though
they weighed more heavily upon the colonies than on the
mother country, and were to the colonies ‘impertinent
badges of slavery’. The conclusion to be drawn is that,
assuming Great Britain to have adequately discharged
the duty of protecting the colonies, she was not adequately
paid for doing so by the results of the mercantile system.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(2) Did
Great
Britain
neglect
the
defence
of the
North
American
colonies?</div>

<p>But it was further contended that the duty of protecting
her colonies was one which Great Britain neglected.
While the colonies were poor and insignificant, the mother
country, it was alleged, neglected them. When they
became richer and more valuable she tried to oppress
them. If the charge of neglect in the general sense was
true, we may refer to Mr. Lecky’s words already quoted,
as showing that it may well be argued that the colonies
profited by it.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Mr. Lecky writes of conditions in the
eighteenth century, but Adam Smith used similar terms
with reference to the earlier days of the colonies. Contrasting
the Spanish colonies in America with those owned
by other European nations on that continent, he wrote:
‘The Spanish colonies’ (in consequence of their mineral
wealth) ‘from the moment of their first establishment
attracted very much the attention of their mother country;
while those of the other European nations were for a long
time in a great measure neglected. The former did not
perhaps thrive the better in consequence of this attention,
nor the latter the worse in consequence of their neglect.’<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
It may be answered, however, that the neglect here
referred to was neglect of the colonies in their internal
concerns, leaving them, as Adam Smith puts it, to pursue
their interest in their own way. This was an undeniably
beneficial form of neglect, wholly different from the
neglect which leaves distant dependencies exposed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
foreign invasion and native raids. Was then the British
Government guilty of the latter form of neglect in the
case of the American colonies?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
attitude
of the
mother
country
in the
earlier
history
of the
colonies.</div>

<p>There were many instances in the history of these
colonies, while they were still under the British flag, of
the Imperial Government promising assistance which was
never sent, or only sent after months of delay: there were
instances of gross incapacity on the part of leaders of
expeditions sent out from home, notably in the case
of Walker and Hill, who commanded the disgracefully
abortive enterprise against Quebec in 1711. The state
of Acadia, when nominally in British keeping after the
Treaty of Utrecht, was a glaring illustration of English
supineness and procrastination. There was, at any rate,
one notable instance of the mother country depriving the
colonies of a great result of their own brilliant enterprise,
viz. when Louisbourg, taken by the New Englanders
in 1745, was restored by Great Britain to France under
the terms of the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle in 1748. Undoubtedly
Great Britain on many occasions disappointed
and disheartened the colonies, and especially the most
patriotic of the colonies, the New England states. On
the other hand, it is beyond question that the colonies
were never seriously attacked by sea. They were threatened,
sometimes badly threatened, as by d’Anville’s fleet
in 1746; they were liable to the raids of daring partisan
leaders, such as d’Iberville; but either good fortune or the
British fleet, supplemented no doubt by a wholesome
respect for the energy and activity of the New England
sailors themselves, kept the coasts and seaports of the
American colonies in comparative security through all the
years of war. It must be noted too that, while the colonies
suffered because Great Britain had interests elsewhere
than in America; while, for instance, a fleet designed for
the benefit of the colonies in 1709 was sent off to Portugal,
and the New Englanders’ prize of Louisbourg was forfeited
in order to secure Madras for the British Empire, the
colonies at the same time shared in the results of victories<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
won in other parts of the world than America. The Peace
of Utrecht, with what it gave to the English in America,
was entirely the outcome of Marlborough’s victories on
the continent of Europe. Nothing that was done in
America contributed to it. The failures of England were
under the colonies’ eyes; her successes, the fruits of which
they shared, were often achieved at the other side of the
world.</p>

<p>But, taking the main events which contributed to the
security and greatness of the American colonies, how far
should they be credited to Great Britain and how far to
the colonies themselves? In earlier days, nothing was
more important to the future of the English in America
than securing a continuous seaboard and linking the
southern to the northern colonies. This object was obtained
by taking New York from the Dutch, the result of
action initiated in Europe, not in America. The final
reduction of Port Royal was effected with the assistance
of troops and ships from England. The Peace of Utrecht,
which deprived the French of Acadia and their settlements
in Newfoundland, was, as already stated, wholly the
result of Marlborough’s fighting in Europe. Though the <span class="sidenote">The conquest of Canada was mainly due to the mother country.</span>
New Englanders took Louisbourg, and England gave it
back to France, the colonists’ success was largely aided
by Warren’s squadron of Imperial ships. But, most of
all, the final conquest of Canada was due far more to
the action of the mother country than to that of the
colonies.</p>

<p>The great, almost the only, foreign danger to the English
colonies in North America was from the French in Canada
and Louisiana, but it is not generally realized how enormously
the English on the North American continent
outnumbered the French. At the time of the conquest
of Canada, the white population of the English colonies
in North America was to that of the French colonies as
thirteen to one. It is true that the English did not form
one community, whereas the French were united; but
it is also true, on the other hand, that the several English<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
communities were more concentrated than the French,
and that they held the base of the triangle, which base
was the sea. A single one of the larger English colonies
had a white population equal to or surpassing the whole
French population in North America. Under these circumstances
it might fairly be asked why the English
colonists required any help at all from the mother country
to conquer Canada. The war was one in which they
were vitally concerned. Its object was to give present
security to their frontiers, to rid them once for all from
the raids of French and Indians, which had for generations
desolated their villages, farms, and homesteads, and to
leave the West as a heritage to their children’s children,
instead of allowing the valleys of the Mississippi and the
Ohio to remain a French preserve. No doubt it was to
the interest of Great Britain, as an Imperial Power, that
France should be attacked and, if possible, overthrown
in the New World as in the Old. The conquest of Canada
was part of Pitt’s general scheme of policy, and English
regiments were not sent to America for the sake of the
American colonists alone.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But the allegation made in
after years, that the campaigns in America were of great
concern to the mother country and of little concern to the
American colonies, was on the face of it untrue. To the
English colonists in North America the French in Canada
were the one great present danger, and the conquest of
Canada was the one thing needful. Yet we find that, in
1758, the troops, nearly 12,000 in number, which achieved
the second capture of Louisbourg were nearly all regulars;
that in the force which Abercromby led against Ticonderoga
about one-half of the total fighting men were
soldiers of the line, and that even Forbes’ little army,
which took Fort Duquesne, contained 1,600 regulars out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
of a total of 6,000 men. In the following year, Wolfe’s
army, which took Quebec, was almost entirely composed of
Imperial troops. Nor was this all. Although, in 1758,
the colonies, or rather the New England colonies, readily
answered to Pitt’s call for a levy of 20,000 men, a considerable
part of the expense which was thus incurred
was recouped from the Imperial exchequer.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The conclusion
of the whole matter is that to the mother country,
rather than to the colonies themselves, was it due that
the great danger which had menaced the latter for a
century and a half was finally removed. England gave
the best of her fighting men, and loaded her people at
home with a debt of many millions, in order that her great
competitor might be weakened, and that her children on
the other side of the Atlantic might be for all time secure
on land from foreign foes, while her fleets kept them safe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
from attack by sea; and, inasmuch as the French in
America were numerically insignificant as compared with
the English colonists, the only real justification for the
colonists requiring aid from the mother country to overcome
the difficulty was, that the English colonies were
by geography and interest divided from each other and
consequently indifferent to each other’s burdens and perils;
while Canada, united in aim and organization, received
also assistance, though niggardly assistance, from France.</p>

<p>The French were the main enemies to the English in
North America. The native Indians were the only other
human beings against whom the colonists had to defend
themselves, and here clearly it was their concern alone. <span class="sidenote">Aid given by the mother country against the Indians.</span>
The New Englanders took the burden on themselves manfully,
so far as related to their own borders, but they were
not prepared to fight the battles of the Pennsylvanians
and Virginians; and the Pennsylvanians and Virginians
were slow to help themselves. The result was, as told in
the last chapter, that the brunt of the war with Pontiac
and his confederates fell largely on the mother country,
her officers, and her troops, and this fact alone was
sufficient justification for Grenville’s contention, that a
small Imperial force ought to be maintained in, and be
in part paid by, the American colonies.</p>

<div class="sidenote">(3) Argument
that
because
the
mother
country
dictated
the policy
she ought
to bear
the
expense.</div>

<p>But then comes the last and the strongest argument of
the colonies. The mother country dictated the policy;
distant and without direct representation, though their
agents were active in England, the colonies could only
follow where the mother country led: the mother country,
therefore, should pay the cost of defending the outlying
provinces; or, if the latter contributed at all to the cost,
it was for them and not for the mother country to determine
the amount and the method of the contribution.
The real answer to this argument was, as Adam Smith <span class="sidenote">Question of colonial representation in the Imperial Parliament.</span>
saw,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> that the colonies should be represented in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Imperial Parliament. He allowed that such a proposal
was beset by difficulties, but he did not consider, as Burke
considered, that the difficulties were insurmountable.
Yet the problem, infinitely easier in the days of steam
and telegraphy, has not yet been solved, and the preliminary
task of combining a group of self-governing
colonies into a single confederation had, in the eighteenth
century, only been talked of and never been seriously
attempted in North America.</p>

<p>In theory, English citizens, who had never been taxed
directly for Imperial purposes, might fairly claim not to
be taxed, unless and until they were taken into full partnership
and given a voice in determining the policy of the
Empire. But the actual facts of the case made the demand
of the mother country on the American colonies in itself
eminently reasonable. It was true that England had <span class="sidenote">Moderation of the English demand on the colonies.</span>
dictated the policy; but it was also true that the policy
had been directly in the interests of the colonies, and such
as they warmly approved. They were asked for money,
but only for their own protection, and to preclude the
possibility of a further burden falling on the mother
country, already overweighted with debt incurred on
behalf of these particular provinces of the Empire. The
demand was a small one; the money to be raised would
clearly defray but a fraction of the cost of defending the
North American colonies. To the amount no reasonable
exception could be taken; and as to the method of raising
it the colonies were, as a matter of fact, consulted, for
Grenville, the author of the Stamp Act, gave a year’s
notice, before the Act was finally passed,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> in order that
the colonies might, in the meantime, if they could, agree
upon some more palatable method of providing the sum
required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">England
suffered
for her
merits as
well as for
her
defects.</div>

<p>The merits of England, no less than her defects, tended
to alienate the North American colonies. It is possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
that, if she had made a larger and more sweeping demand,
she would have been more successful. Her requisition
was so moderate, that it seemed to be petty, and might
well have aroused suspicion that there was more behind;
that what was actually proposed was an insidious preliminary
to some far-reaching scheme for oppressing the
colonies and bringing them into subjection. It has been
held, too, that, if the Stamp Act had been passed without
delay, there would have been less opposition to it than
when it had been brooded over for many months. In
other words, the fairness of dealing, which gave full
warning and full time for consideration of a carefully
measured demand, was turned to account against the
mother country. But after all what was in men’s minds,
when the American colonies began their contest for <span class="sidenote">The analogy of family life in the case of a mother country and its colonies.</span>
independence was, speaking broadly, the feeling, right or
wrong, that a mother country ought to pay and colonies
ought not. Men argued then, and they still argue, from
the analogy of a family. The head of the family should
provide, as long as the children remain part of the household.</p>

<p>The analogy of family life suggests a further view of
the relations between a mother country and its colonies,
which accounts for the possibilities of friction. A colonial
empire consists of an old community linked to young ones.
The conditions, the standards, the points of view, in
politics, in morals, in social and industrial matters, are not
identical in old and young communities. Young peoples,
like young men, do not count the cost, and do not feel
responsibility to the same extent as their elders. They
are more restive, more ready to move forward, more
prompt in action. Their horizon is limited, and therefore
they see immediate objects clearly, and they do not
appreciate compromise. The problems which face them
are simple as compared with the complicated questions
which face older communities, and they are impatient
of the caution and hesitation which come with inherited
experience in a much wider field of action. The future<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
is theirs rather than the past, they have not yet accumulated
much capital and draw bills on the coming time.
Most of all, being on promotion, they are sensitive as to
their standing, keenly alive to their interests, and resent
any semblance of being slighted. It is impossible to
generalize as to the comparative standards of morality in
old and young communities, either in public or in private
life, but, as a matter of fact, political life, in the middle
of the eighteenth century, was much purer in the North
American colonies than in England: whereas at the present
day, in this respect, England compares favourably with
the United States. The North American colonies were
a group of young communities, whose citizens were, at
any rate in New England and Pennsylvania, of a strong,
sober, and very tenacious type: the late war had taught
them to fight: its issue had given them a feeling of
strength and security: there had been no extraordinary
strain upon their resources: they had reached a stage in
their history when they were most dangerous to offend and
not unlikely to take offence unless very carefully handled,
and careful handling on the part of the mother country,
as all the world knows, was conspicuous by its absence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Native
question.</div>

<p>One more point may be noted as having an important
bearing upon the general question of the relations between
a mother country and its colonies, one which in particular
contributed to ill-feeling between England and the North
American states. Colonization rarely takes place in an
empty land. The colonists on arrival find native inhabitants,
strong or weak, few or many, as the case may be.
In North America there were strong fighting races of
Indians, and the native question played an all-important
part in the early history of European settlement in this
part of the world. It is almost inevitable that white men
on the spot, who are in daily contact with natives, should,
unless they hold a brief as missionaries or philanthropists,
take a different view of native rights and claims from
that which is held at a distance. It is true that in our
own time, to take one instance only, the Maori question<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
in New Zealand has been well handled by the colonial
authorities, when thrown on their own resources, with
the result that there are no more loyal members of the
British Empire at the present day than the coloured
citizens of New Zealand; but in the earlier days of
colonization the general rule has been that native races
fare better under Imperial than under colonial control,
for the twofold reason that the distant authority is less
influenced by colour prejudice, and that white men who
go out from Europe to settle among native races are, in
the ordinary course, of a rougher type than those who
stay at home, and that they tend to become hardened
by living among lower grades of humanity. The Quaker
followers of Penn, in the state which bears his name, were
conspicuous for just and kindly treatment of the Indians,
but in the back-lands of Pennsylvania the traders and
pioneers of settlement were to the full as grasping as their
neighbours. The North American Puritan, like the South
African Dutchman, looked on the coloured man much as
the Jewish race regarded the native tribes of Canaan.
The colonists came in and took the land of the heathen
in possession. Indian atrocities, stimulated by French
influence and French missionary training, were not
calculated to soften the views of the English settlers.
They saw their homes burned: their wives and children
butchered: to them arguments as to the red men’s rights
were idle words.</p>

<p>The only authority which could and would hold the
balance even between the races was the Imperial Government;
and in the hands of that Government, represented
for the purpose in the middle of the eighteenth century
by a man of rare ability and unrivalled experience, Sir
William Johnson, the superintendence of native affairs
was placed. But this duty, and the attempt to carry it
out justly and faithfully, involved friction with the more
turbulent and the less scrupulous of the colonists. Colonization
is a tide which is always coming in; and, unless restrictions
are imposed upon the colonists by some superior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
authority, the native owners are gradually expropriated.
‘Your people,’ said the representatives of the Six Nations
to Sir William Johnson in 1755, ‘when they buy a small
piece of land of us, by stealing they make it large;’<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> and
Johnson amply corroborated this view. In October,
1762, he wrote: ‘The Indians are greatly disgusted at
the great thirst which we all seem to show for their lands.’<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir
William
Johnson.</div>

<p>A word must be said of Sir William Johnson, for he
was one of the men who, in the long course of British
colonial history, have rendered memorable service to
their country by special aptitude for dealing with native
races. In this quality the French in North America, as
a rule, far excelled the English, and at the particular
place and time, Johnson’s character and influence were
an invaluable asset on the British side. An Irishman by
birth, and nephew of Sir Peter Warren, he had come out
to America in 1738 to manage his uncle’s estates on the
confines of the Six Nation Indians, and some eleven years
later he was made Superintendent of Indian Affairs for
the Northern division. He lived on the Mohawk river,
as much Indian as white man, his second wife being
Molly Brant, sister of the subsequently celebrated Mohawk
leader, and among the Iroquois his influence was unrivalled.
In the wars with France he did notable work,
especially at the battle of Lake George in 1755, and at
the taking of Fort Niagara in 1759; and, when he died in
July, 1774, on the eve of the War of Independence, his
death left a gap which could not be filled, for no one
among his contemporaries could so persuade and so control
the fiercest native fighters in North America.</p>

<p>As has been seen, the Royal Proclamation of 1763
carefully safeguarded the Indians’ lands, and in 1765
a line was drawn from the Ohio valley to Wood Creek in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
the Oneida country, dividing the country which should in
future be open to white settlers from that which the Six
Nations were to hold for their own. This boundary was,
through Johnson’s influence, confirmed by an agreement
signed at Fort Stanwix on the 5th of November, 1768, in <span class="sidenote">The Fort Stanwix line.</span>
the presence of Johnson himself as well as of Benjamin
Franklin’s son, who was at the time Governor of New
Jersey. The signatories were representatives of the
colonies of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia on the
one hand, and deputies of the Six Nations on the other; and
the Indians were described as ‘true and absolute proprietors
of the lands in question’. The line diverged from
the Alleghany branch of the Ohio some miles above
Pittsburg; it was carried in a north-easterly direction
to the Susquehanna; from the Susquehanna it was taken
east to the Delaware; and from the Delaware it was
carried north along the course of the Unadilla river, ending
near Fort Stanwix, now the town of Rome, in Oneida
county of the state of New York. Under the terms of
the agreement all the land east of the line was, for a sum
of £10,460 7<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> sold to the King, except such part as
was within the province of Pennsylvania.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> It was a
definite recognition of the Indians as being owners of
land, and a definite pronouncement that what they sold
should be sold to the Crown. Neither tenet was likely to
commend itself to the border colonists. They would find
it hard to believe that a savage’s tenure of land was as
valid as that of a white man, nor would they welcome the
Imperial Government as landlord of the hinterland. The
red man thought otherwise. The power from over the
seas, which the colonists soon learnt to denounce as the
enemy of liberty, was to them the protector of life and
land: and, when the struggle was over, many of the
Six Nation Indians were to be found in Canada, not in
their old homes under the flag of the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attitude
of the
Canadians.</div>

<p>Nor were the Indians the only inhabitants of North<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
America who did not see eye to eye with the colonists in
their contest with the mother country. In October, 1774,
the General Congress of the recalcitrant colonies issued
a long manifesto to their ‘friends and fellow subjects’ in
Canada, inviting them to ‘unite with us in one social
compact formed on the generous principles of equal
liberty’. The manifesto appealed to the writings of ‘the
immortal Montesquieu’, the ‘countryman’ of the French
Canadians, and warned the latter not to become the
instruments of the cruelty and despotism of English
ministers, but to stand firm for their natural liberties,
alleged to be threatened by the Quebec Act which had
just been passed. But the high-sounding appeal missed
its mark. It is true that at the beginning of the war, when
Canada was left almost undefended, and when, in consequence,
Montgomery and the Congress troops overran the
country up to the walls of Quebec, a considerable number
of the French Canadians, together with the British
malcontents in Canada, openly or secretly made common
cause with the invaders; but even then the large majority
of the French Canadians remained neutral, and, if some
joined the ranks of the invaders, others, including especially
the higher ranks of the population, supported her
cause. Here was a people lately conquered, under the rule
of an alien race. A golden opportunity was given them,
it seemed, to recover their freedom. Why did the French
colonists not throw in their lot wholehearted with the
English settlers in North America? Why did they prefer
to remain under the British Crown?</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Canadians
were not
oppressed
under
English
rule.</div>

<p>The first reason was that they were not oppressed. On
the contrary they had already enjoyed more liberty under
the British Government than under the old French
régime. There were complaints, no doubt, as will be
seen, but the Canadians were free to make them; there
was no stifling of discontent, no stamping out of inconvenient
pleas for liberty. With British rule came in the
printing press. The <i>Quebec Gazette</i> was first issued in
June, 1764, and in it the ordinances were published in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
French as well as in English. Even under military
administration a formerly submissive people learnt their
privileges and their rights, and General Murray, whose
recall was due to allegations that he had unduly favoured
the French population at the expense of the Protestant
Loyalists, wrote of the Canadians as a ‘frugal, industrious,
moral race of men who, from the just and mild treatment
they met with from His Majesty’s military officers, who
ruled the country four years, until the establishment of civil
government, had greatly got the better of the natural
antipathy they had to their conquerors’.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Canada was
not anxious to overturn a system under which Canadians
were being trained to be free. If England oppressed, she
oppressed Englishmen rather than Frenchmen or natives,
and one element in the alleged oppression of her own
people consisted in safeguarding the rights of other races.</p>

<div class="sidenote">They preferred
the
English
in and
from
England
to the
English
colonists
in
America.</div>

<p>The second and the main reason why Canada did not
combine with the United States was that, though Canadians
did not love the English from England, they loved less
their English neighbours in America. Charles the Second
told his brother that the English would not kill himself to
make James king. Similarly the Canadians, on reflection,
were not prepared to turn out the British Government
in order to substitute the domination of the English
colonies. Generalities as to natural rights and equal
liberties, borrowed from the writings of European philosophers,
could not cover up the plain facts of the case.
Canada, united to the English colonies, would have been
submerged, and French Roman Catholics would have been
permanently subject to English Protestants, far less
tolerant than Englishmen at home. The colonists who
had issued the high-sounding manifesto had done so
with strong resentment at the extension of the limits of
the province of Quebec, at the widening of the field in
which the Canadian system and the religion of Canada
should hold its own. They were speaking with two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
voices at one and the same time; calling on the Canadians
not to submit to British tyranny, and denouncing
as tyranny a measure which favoured Canada. Many
years back the Canadians and their friends had differentiated
between the English from England, who came out
to fight, and the English colonists in America. The eye-witness
of the siege and capture of Louisbourg in 1745
favourably, and probably unfairly, contrasted Warren and
his British sailors with Pepperell and the New England
levies. To the men from a distance, better disciplined,
less prejudiced, less imbued with provincial animosity,
there was no such aversion as to the enemy who was ever
under their eyes. At all times and in all parts of the
world there has been the same tale to tell; if one race
must be subordinated to another, it prefers that its rulers
should not be those who for generations have been their
immediate neighbours and their persistent rivals.</p>

<p>It was written in the book of fate that New France
should sooner or later become incorporated in the British
Empire; it was written too that, when that time came,
the British provinces in North America would assert and
win complete independence. It is impossible to estimate
aright the loss except in the light of the gain which preceded
it. Only consummate statesmanship or military
genius could have averted the severance of the North
American colonies, for the very qualities which had
brought success alike to them and to the motherland,
dogged persistence, sense of strength, all the instincts and
the principles which have made the English great, were
ranged on either side in the civil war between England
and her children: and that war was the direct, almost
the inevitable result of their recent joint effort and their
united victory. Friction began: years went on: bitterness
was intensified: the noisier and less scrupulous
partisans silenced the voice of reason: in the mother
country the Sovereign and his advisers made a good cause
bad: the revolting colonies were ennobled by Washington.
Success justified the action of the colonists. England<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
was condemned because she failed. Yet the story, if read
aright, teaches only this: that the defeat of England by
her own children was due to the simple fact that partly by
her action, partly by her inaction, the children in wayward
and blundering fashion had grown to greatness.</p>

<p>After the capitulation of Montreal, in September, 1760,
Canada was, for the time being, under military rule. <span class="sidenote">Canada under military rule.</span>
There were three military governors, General Murray at
Quebec, Colonel Burton at Three Rivers, and General
Gage at Montreal. All three were subordinate to Amherst,
the Commander-in-Chief in North America, whose head
quarters were usually at New York. Amherst left for
England in 1763, and was succeeded by General Gage,
whose place was filled by the transfer of Burton from
Three Rivers, while the military governorship of Three
Rivers was entrusted to Colonel Haldimand, one of the
Swiss officers who deserved so well of England in North
America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
French
Canadians
at
the time
of the
British
conquest
of
Canada.</div>

<p>While Canada was still under military rule, and before
the Peace of Paris was signed, the British Government
took steps to collect full information as to their newly-acquired
possession, with a view to determining the lines
on which it should be administered in future. At the end
of 1761 Amherst was instructed to obtain the necessary
reports, which were in the following year duly supplied
by Murray, Burton, and Gage in respect of Quebec, Three
Rivers, and Montreal respectively.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Canada at this time contained little more than 70,000
white inhabitants. The population, Murray thought, had
tended to decrease for twenty years past, owing to war, to
the strictness of the marriage laws, and to the prohibition
of marriages between Protestants and Roman Catholics;
but he looked for a large increase from natural causes in
the next twenty years, the men being strong and the
women extremely prolific.</p>

<p>The Canadians, Murray wrote, were ‘mostly of a Norman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
race’ and, ‘in general, of a litigious disposition’. He
classified them into the gentry, the clergy, the merchants,
and the peasantry or habitants. The gentry or seigniors,
descendants of military or civil officers, the creation
largely of Louis XIV, Colbert, and Talon, he described as
for the most part men of small means, unless they had
held one or other of the distant posts, where they could
make their fortunes. ‘They are extremely vain, and
have an utter contempt for the trading part of the colony,
though they made no scruple to engage in it, pretty deeply
too, whenever a convenient opportunity served. They
were great tyrants to their vassals, who seldom met with
redress, let their grievances be ever so just. This class will
not relish the British Government, from which they can
neither expect the same employments or the same douceurs
they enjoyed under the French.’ Of the clergy he
wrote that the higher ranks were filled by Frenchmen,
the rest being Canadian born, and in general Canadians of
the lower class. Similarly the wholesale traders were
mostly French, and the retail traders natives of Canada.
The peasantry he described as ‘a strong, healthy race,
plain in their dress, virtuous in their morals, and temperate
in their living’, extremely ignorant, and extremely tenacious
of their religion. At the time of writing, Murray and
his colleagues evidently anticipated more loyalty from
the peasantry than from the higher classes of Canadians.
Protected in their religion, given impartial justice, freed
from class oppression and official corruption, they seemed
likely to develop into happy and contented subjects of
the British Crown. The sequel was, however, to show
that more support would accrue to the new rulers of
Canada from the classes which had something to lose
than from the credulous habitants.</p>

<p>‘The French,’ so ran Murray’s report, ‘bent their
whole attention in this part of the world to the fur-trade.’
They neglected agriculture and the fisheries. ‘The
inhabitants are inclinable enough to be lazy, and not
much skilled in husbandry, the great dependencies they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
have hitherto had on the gun and fishing-rod made
them neglect tillage beyond the requisites of their own
consumption and the few purchases they needed.’ Gage
wrote that ‘the only immediate importance and advantage
the French king derived from Canada was the
preventing the extension of the British colonies, the consumption
of the commodities and manufactures of France,
and the trade of pelletry’. He noted how common it was
‘for the servants, whom the merchants hired to work
their boats and assist in their trade, through a long habit
of Indian manners and customs, at length to adopt their
way of life, to intermarry with them, and turn savages’.
Burton’s report was to the same effect: ‘The laziness of
the people, and the alluring and momentary advantages
they reaped from their traffic with the Indians in the
upper countries, and the counterband trade they carried
on with the English colonies, have hitherto prevented
the progress of husbandry;’ and again, ‘The greatest
part of the young men, allured by the debauched and
rambling life which always attend the Indian trade in the
upper countries, never thought of settling at home till they
were almost worn out with diseases or premature old age.’</p>

<p>It was a country and a people of strong contrasts,
wholly unlike their own colonies, that the English were
called upon to rule. At head quarters and near it there
was a cast-iron system in Church and State, trade monopoly,
an administration at once despotic and corrupt.
Behind there was a boundless wild, to which French
restlessness, French adaptability for dealing with native
races, and the possibilities of illicit wealth called the
young and enterprising, who were impatient of control, and
who could not share the gains of corruption at Montreal
and Quebec. In Canada there was no gradual and continuous
widening of settlement, such as marked the English
colonies in North America. In those colonies development
was spontaneous but, in the main, civilized; not
according to fixed rule, but not contrary to law, the law
being home-made and not imposed from without.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>In Canada extreme conservatism existed side by side
with complete lawlessness. At one pole of society were
a certain number of obedient human beings, planted out
in rows; at the other were the wandering fur-traders, who
knew no law and had no fixed dwelling-place. Excluding
the officials from France, ill paid and intent on perquisites
alone, and excluding French or Canadian merchants, the
main constituents in the population of Canada were the
seignior, the priest, the habitant, and the voyageur; of
these four elements it would be hard to say which was
farthest removed from citizenship, as it was understood
in England and the English colonies. Yet all these elements
were to be combined and moulded into a British
community.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Beginning
of
civil
government.</div>

<p>The beginning of civil administration in Canada under
British rule was the Royal Proclamation of 7th October,
1763, which has been noticed in the preceding chapter.
Before it was issued, an intimation was sent to Murray
that he had been selected as the first civil governor of the
new British province of Quebec. His commission as
governor was dated 21st November, 1763; and the Royal
Instructions, which accompanied the Commission, bore the
date of 7th December, 1763; but it was not until August,
1764, that he took up his new position and military rule
came to an end.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Murray.</div>

<p>James Murray was still under forty years of age. He
proved himself a stanch, loyal, and capable soldier,
resolute in critical times, as when he defended Quebec
through the trying winter of 1759-60, and later, in 1781-2,
held Minorca until his handful of troops, stricken with
famine and disease, surrendered their arms, as they said,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
to God alone. His words and his actions alike testified
that he was a humane and just man. Like other soldiers,
before and since, having seen war face to face, he was
more ready than civilians who had not risked their lives,
but breathed threatenings and slaughter from a safe
distance, to treat the conquered with leniency.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties
of the
situation.</div>

<p>He had many difficulties to contend with. Military
matters did not run smoothly. In September, 1763,
there had been a dangerous mutiny among the troops at
Quebec. It was caused by an ill-timed order sent out
from home to the effect that the soldiers should pay for
their rations; and serious consequences might have
followed but for the prompt and firm attitude of the
general and his officers. At Quebec, Murray combined
civil and military powers; but after civil administration
had been proclaimed, though his government included
the whole of the province as constituted by the Royal
proclamation, he was left without authority over the
troops at Montreal, where Burton jealously retained an
independent military command. The inevitable result
was to fetter his action to a great extent, to give to the
Canadians the impression of divided authority,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and to
accentuate friction between soldiers and civilians, which <span class="sidenote">Ill feeling between soldiers and civilians.</span>
culminated in an assault at Montreal in December, 1764,
on a magistrate named Walker, who had made himself
specially obnoxious to the officers of the garrison. Two
years later the supposed perpetrators of the outrage were
tried and acquitted, but the affair left ill feeling behind it,
and Walker remained an active and pertinacious opponent
of the British Government in Canada.</p>

<p>Among the Canadian population there were various
causes of unrest. The priesthood were anxious as to
their position and privileges. The depreciation of the
paper money, which had been issued under the French
régime, gave trouble. The law was in a state of chaos;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
and, most of all, the first Governor of Canada had to withstand
the pretensions of the handful of Protestants, in <span class="sidenote">The Protestant minority.</span>
1764 about 200 in number, in 1766 about 450, who wished
to dominate the French Canadians, alien in religion and
in race.</p>

<p>Against the claims of this small but noisy and intriguing
minority Murray resolutely set his face, but the difficulties
which arose led to his being summoned home. He left <span class="sidenote">Murray leaves for England and is succeeded by Carleton.</span>
Canada for England towards the end of June, 1766, and
though he retained the post of Governor till April, 1768,
he never returned to Quebec.</p>

<p>His successor was Guy Carleton, who arrived in Canada
in September, 1766, and carried on the administration as
Lieutenant-Governor till 1768, when he became Governor-in-chief.
Like Murray, he was a soldier of distinction,
and had been a warm personal friend of Wolfe, who made
him one of the executors of his will. He was born in
1724, at Strabane in the north of Ireland, the third son of
General Sir Guy Carleton. He went into the Guards,
was transferred to the 72nd Regiment, and served in
Germany, at Louisbourg, and, as Quartermaster-General,
with Wolfe at Quebec. He remained at Quebec with
Murray during the eventful winter of 1759-60; and,
after further active service at Belle Isle and Havana, he
came back to Quebec in 1766, to do more than any one
man in war and peace for the safety and well-being of
Canada as a British possession.</p>

<p>The difficulties which Murray had been called upon to
meet confronted him also, and, like Murray, he saw the
necessity as well as the justice of resisting the extravagant
claims of the minority, and conciliating to British rule the
large body of the Canadian population. For nearly four
years he remained at his post, forming his views as to the
lines on which Canada should be remodelled. In August,
1770, he left for England on leave of absence, and in
England he remained until the Quebec Act had been
passed. The Act was passed in June, 1774, taking effect
from the 1st of May in the following year; and in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
middle of September, 1774, Carleton arrived again at Quebec. <span class="sidenote">Conditions which led to the passing of the Quebec Act.</span>
It is now proposed to review the conditions which
led to the passing of the Act, and the policy which was embodied
in it, omitting as far as possible minor incidents
and dealing only with the main features, which illustrate
the general course of British colonial history.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Conquest
of
Canada
presented
a new
problem
in British
colonial
history.</div>

<p>The acquisition of Canada presented to British statesmen
a wholly new problem. The British Empire had
hitherto widened mainly by means of settlement, for the
seventeenth century, as far as Great Britain was concerned,
was a time of settlement, not of conquest. Jamaica,
it is true, had been taken from the Spaniards, and New
York from the Dutch; but, great as was the importance
of securing those two dependencies in the light of subsequent
history, the conquest or cession of both the one and
the other was rather an incident than the result of an
era of war and conquest. Such an era came with the
eighteenth century; and, when the Peace of Utrecht in
1713 secured Great Britain in undivided possession of
Newfoundland, and confirmed to her the possession of
the Acadian peninsula, and of the Rock of Gibraltar, a
notable outpost of the future Empire, there was a beginning,
though a small beginning, of territorial expansion
as the result of war.</p>

<p>The Seven Years’ War brought with it British conquest
alike in East and West; but in India the British advance
was in some sort a repetition on a wider scale of what other
European nations had done in the same regions. It was
the natural outcome of trade rivalry, and of white men
coming among Eastern races. The conquest of Canada, <span class="sidenote">Canada was: (1) a continental area;
(2) colonized by another European race; (3) bordering on a sphere of British colonization; (4) the home of a coloured race.</span>
on the other hand, differed in kind from all that had gone
before in British history. The Imperial Government of
Great Britain took over a great expanse of continent, and
became, by force of arms, proprietor of a country which
another colonizing race had acquired by settlement. The
new problems were how to administer and to develop not
a small island or peninsula but a very large continental
area, and how to rule a rival white race which from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
beginnings of colonization in North America had made
that area, or part of it, its own. To these two most
difficult problems was added a third, how to administer
the new territory and to rule the French colonists, so as
to work in harmony with the adjacent British colonies.
Conquest and settlement, so to speak, overlapped. If
Canada had not been a French colony, and had been
inhabited by coloured men alone, or if Canada, as a French
colony, had been in a different continent from the British
North American colonies, the task of construction or
re-construction would have been infinitely easier. It
would have been easier, too, if the French Canadians had
been the only inhabitants of Canada. But, as it was, one
white race conquered another white race, which in its
turn had secured mastery over a coloured race, and in
the land of that coloured race had not merely conquered
or traded, but settled and colonized; and the new conquerors
were of the same kith and kin as settlers in the
adjoining territories, whose traditions were all traditions
not of ruling nor of conquering so much as of gradually
acquiring by settlement at the expense of the coloured
race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Conditions
which
guided
British
policy in
Canada
as embodied
in
the Proclamation
of 1763.</div>

<p>What had British statesmen to guide them in dealing
with the question, and what considerations led to the
provisions which were embodied in their first measure, the
Royal Proclamation of 7th October, 1763? It was evident, <span class="sidenote">Geographical division between the settled districts and the hinterland.</span>
in the first place, that a line could, if it was thought advisable,
be drawn between the settled parts of Canada and
the Western territories, where the French had only maintained
outposts and trading stations. The government of <span class="sidenote">The Indian question.</span>
Quebec, therefore, which was the new colony, was, as has
been seen, limited to the districts of Quebec, Three Rivers,
and Montreal, and did not include the regions of the lakes,
or the territories of the Hudson’s Bay Company. In the
second place, past experience had proved that English
dealings with the Indians had been very much less successful
than French management, the characteristic features
of which were personal relations with a despotic governor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
and his authorized agents and representatives; and that
the Indians enjoyed more protection and were likely to
develop greater loyalty and contentment under a central
authority—the Imperial Government—represented and
advised by Sir William Johnson, than if left to bargain
with and to resent encroachments by the various British
colonies. Consequently the proclamation reserved the
western hinterland ‘under our sovereignty, protection,
and dominion for the use of the said Indians’, in addition
to safeguarding the existing rights and lands of the natives
within the borders of the colonies. In the third place it <span class="sidenote">Necessity for attracting British colonists</span>
was obviously desirable to introduce into Canada a leaven
of colonists of English race, and more especially of colonists
who had been trained to arms and already knew the land
and the people. Hence, just as in bygone days Colbert
and Talon, when colonizing Canada on a definite system,
planted time-expired soldiers along the St. Lawrence and
the Richelieu rivers, so the Proclamation of 1763 empowered
free land grants to be given in Canada, as well
as in the other American possessions of Great Britain,
to officers and soldiers who had served in the late war;
and it also encouraged British settlers generally by providing
that, as soon as circumstances allowed, a General
Assembly was to be summoned ‘in such manner and form
as is used and directed in those colonies and provinces in
America which are under our immediate government.’<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">and for
conciliating
the
French
Canadians.</div>

<p>But most of all it was necessary to mete out fair and
liberal treatment to the new subjects, the French Canadians,
and make them contented citizens of the British Empire.
This object, Englishmen naturally argued, could best be attained,
first, by securing ‘the ancient inhabitants in all the
titles, rights, and privileges granted to them by Treaty’<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>;
and secondly, by giving the Canadians as soon as possible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the laws and institutions which British subjects valued
and under which they had thrived, by assimilating
Canada as far as possible in these respects to the neighbouring
British colonies. Accordingly the Canadians were <span class="sidenote">Desire to give British privileges to Canada.</span>
from the first to enjoy the benefit of the laws of England,
and courts of justice were to be established with power to
determine all causes criminal and civil ‘as near as may be
agreeable to the laws of England’. The question of religion
was ignored in the proclamation; freedom of worship had
already been guaranteed to the Roman Catholics by the
4th Article of the Peace of Paris,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> and Murray’s instructions
were that he should ‘in all things regarding the said
inhabitants, conform with great exactness to the stipulations
of the said treaty in this respect’. There the matter
was left for the moment, though Murray’s commission
provided that the persons who should be elected as
members of the future Assembly were to subscribe the
declaration against Popery, enacted in Charles the
Second’s reign, which provision would have excluded
Roman Catholics from sitting in the Assembly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liberal
intention
of the
Proclamation
of
1763.</div>

<p>There is no question that the proclamation itself was
conceived in a wise and tolerant spirit. There was every
intention to safeguard the best interests alike of the French
Canadians and of the Indians; to give to the latter the
protection of Imperial rule, to give to the former the
benefits of British laws, and as far as possible the privileges
of British citizenship. The proclamation, too, was not
drawn on hard and fast lines. As soon as circumstances
permitted, and not before, representative institutions were
to be introduced, and the laws were not to be necessarily
the laws of England, but ‘as near as may be agreeable to’
the laws of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Murray’s
Commission.</div>

<p>Murray’s commission as governor empowered him, ‘so
soon as the situation and circumstances of our said
province under your government will admit thereof, and
when and as often as need shall require, to summon and
call General Assemblies of the freeholders and planters
within your government.’ But by the terms of the
commission a council was joined with the governor and
Assembly as the authority for making laws and ordinances,
and the Royal Instructions provided that, pending the
calling of a General Assembly, the governor was to act
on the advice of his council in making regulations, which
would have the force of law, and which were, as a matter
of fact, styled ordinances, certain important subjects,
such as taxation, being excluded from their scope. Thus,
until representative institutions could be given to Canada,
legislative and executive authority was placed in the hands
of the governor acting on the advice of a nominated
council. But the council, again, was constituted on liberal <span class="sidenote">The Council of government.</span>
lines, as its members were to be the Lieutenant-Governors
of Montreal and Three Rivers, the Chief Justice of the
province of Quebec, the Surveyor-General of Customs in
America for the Northern district, and ‘eight other persons
to be chosen by you from amongst the most considerable
of the inhabitants of, or persons of property in, our said
province’. From the first, therefore, it was intended
that the unofficial element in the council should outnumber
the officials—evidence, if evidence were wanted, that it
was desired to govern Canada in accordance with the
wishes of the people.</p>

<p>Immediately after civil government had taken the place
of military rule, an ordinance was, in September, 1764,
promulgated, constituting courts of justice, the law to <span class="sidenote">Courts of justice established.</span>
be administered being in the main the law of England,
and trial by jury being introduced without any religious
qualification for jurymen. One provision in the ordinance,
it may be noticed in passing, abolished the district of
Three Rivers, which had hitherto been, like Montreal, in
charge of a Lieutenant-Governor. Thus Canada was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
started on its course as a British colony, with the best
intentions, the prospect of such self-government as other
American colonies enjoyed, British law and justice, and
above all a governor who was in sympathy with the <span class="sidenote">Causes of the difficulties which arose.</span>
people, and earnestly worked for their good; but difficulties
arose almost immediately, and the causes of them
are not far to seek.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
religious
question.</div>

<p>It was the honest desire of the British Government to
give liberty to Canada, to treat it, not as a conquered
country, but as a British colony. Liberty, as the English
understand it, has connoted three things, representative
institutions, British law and justice, including especially
trial by jury and the Habeas Corpus Act, and freedom of
conscience. But in past times to Protestants freedom
of conscience meant practical exclusion from the political
sphere of those, like Roman Catholics, whose creed was
in principle an exclusive creed; and therefore, in a Roman
Catholic country under Protestant supremacy, like Ireland
or Canada in the eighteenth century, representative
institutions from the strong Protestant point of view
meant institutions which did not represent the bulk of
the population. In this matter, as in others, in the case
of Canada, English statesmen and English governors,
though not at once prepared to dispense with religious
tests, were more liberally inclined towards the ‘new
subjects’, the French Canadians, than were the English
colonists in America; and the soldier Murray had far
more breadth of mind than the local lawyers and politicians
who prated of liberties which they had no intention
of granting to others.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Murray’s
letter to
Lord
Shelburne.</div>

<p>Shortly after his return to England, in 1766, Murray
expressed his views as to the small Protestant minority in
Canada in plain outspoken terms. In a letter addressed
to Lord Shelburne on the 20th of August in that year, <span class="sidenote">His opinion of the Protestant minority in Canada.</span>
he wrote, ‘most of them were followers of the army, of
mean education, or soldiers disbanded at the reduction of
the troops. All have their fortunes to make, and I fear
few of them are solicitous about the means when the end<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
can be obtained. I report them to be in general the most
immoral collection of men I ever knew, of course little
calculated to make the new subjects enamoured with our
laws, religion, and customs, far less adapted to enforce
these laws and to govern.’ As the Canadian peasantry,
he continued, ‘have been taught to respect their superiors
and not get intoxicated with the abuse of liberty, they
are shocked at the insults which their noblesse and the
King’s officers have received from the English traders and
lawyers, since the civil government took place.... Magistrates
were to be made and juries to be composed from
four hundred and fifty contemptible sutlers and traders ...
the Canadian noblesse were hated because their birth
and behaviour entitled them to respect, and the peasants
were abhorred because they were saved from the oppression
they were threatened with.’ Equally severe was his
judgement on ‘the improper choice and the number of
the civil officers sent out from England’, ignorant of the
law and language, rapacious, and lowering the dignity
of government. In short his letter<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> was a wholesale
condemnation of the representatives of the party which
claimed to represent British civic life in a newly-acquired
possession.</p>

<p>These men had bitterly attacked Murray, and no doubt
Murray was bitter in turn; but his strictures were largely
justified. He had lived for some years among the
Canadians; he had commanded the King’s troops; himself
a man of high principle and good breeding, he resented
the mischief wrought by a low class of domineering interlopers
who, in the name of freedom, meant to oppress, and
painted as tyranny the policy which prevented oppression.
A continuance of military rule, which the Canadians understood,
would have been infinitely preferable to representative
institutions in which the overwhelming majority of
the population would have had no share.</p>

<p>Carleton’s view was much the same as Murray’s. His<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
sympathies too were with Canada and the Canadians, and
yet the forces and the instincts on the other side are at
least intelligible. It was natural that, when war was over,
in the train of the conquering army there should drift
into the conquered country a certain number of adventurers,
eager for official and professional gain, exploiting
the land and the people, indifferent to higher objects, for
they had not known them. They were an inevitable evil,
such as must be reckoned with in similar circumstances
at all times and in all places. It was natural too that
Protestantism, when ascendant, should be aggressive; <span class="sidenote">Character of American Protestantism.</span>
and Protestantism in Canada was borrowed from the
New England States; it was the Puritanism of past days,
hardened by memories of the evil wrought by Roman
Catholic teaching among the natives of North America,
the fruits of which had been, times without number, a
series of savage crusades against the border villages of
the British colonies. But the British Government, with
all its kindly intentions, was at fault too; and the
fault was the same evil which was poisoning political
life at home. Unfit men were being sent out from home, <span class="sidenote">Unfit men sent out from England.</span>
and the subordinate instruments for carrying out a new
policy, and making a new régime congenial to those who
were to live under it, were not well chosen. Men were
wanted at first rather than institutions. The soldier
governors were good, but the same could not be said of the
civilians and lawyers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pouring
new wine
into old
bottles.</div>

<p>Once more, too, it must be noticed that the actual merits
of British statesmanship and policy militated against its
success. It was so keenly desired to give the new subjects all
the privileges enjoyed by the old, that too little account was
taken of the training, the wishes, and the present needs of
the new subjects. The Canadians were politically children.
They had never known even the semblance of representative
institutions. They had from all time been born and
bred under authority—under the King, under the Church,
under the seigniors. They had learnt unquestioning
obedience, and could not at once be re-cast in a democratic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
mould. The printing press, the Assembly for law-making
and debate, the standing quarrels with governors, the
withholding of supplies, the aggressive freedom in every
form which characterized the English communities in
North America, all were alien to the French Canadian.
The wine might be good, but it was new, and pouring it
into old bottles could only have one result, the loss of the
wine and the bursting of the bottles. So also with British
law and justice: that too was new and largely unintelligible;
the language puzzled and confused, and the
lawyers who came in found the confusion profitable.
Premature attempts or proposals to assimilate only served
to emphasize differences, and for the moment good intentions
paved the way to something like anarchy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Presentment
of the
Grand
Jury in
October,
1764.</div>

<p>In September, 1764, the ordinance constituting courts
of justice was promulgated, and in the following month
the Grand Jury at Quebec made a presentment, enumerating
a number of alleged grievances, concerned not merely
with the administration of justice, but also with various
matters which lay wholly outside their sphere. ‘We
represent,’ so the framers of the presentment wrote, ‘that
as the Grand Jury must be considered at present as the
only body representative of the colony, they, as British
subjects, have a right to be consulted, before any ordinance
that may affect the body that they represent be passed
into a law.’ It was an impertinent document, a kind of
manifesto against the Government; and, taken by itself
alone, gave ample evidence of the class and the temper of
the men who were determined to make trouble in Canada.
It was signed by some French jurors as well as English, but
a supplement to it, signed by the English, or, at any rate,
by the Protestant members alone, protested against Roman
Catholics being admitted as jurors, and it soon appeared
that the French jurors had signed the main document in
ignorance of its contents.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> ‘Little, very little,’ wrote
Murray, ‘will content the new subjects, but nothing will
satisfy the licentious fanatics trading here, but the expulsion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
of the Canadians who are perhaps the bravest and the
best race upon the globe, a race who, could they be
indulged with a few privileges which the laws of England
deny to Roman Catholics at home, would soon get the
better of every national antipathy to their conquerors and
become the most faithful and most useful set of men in
this American Empire.’<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>The Grand Jury’s presentment was followed by a
petition for the recall of Murray, drawn up in the next <span class="sidenote">Petition for recall of Murray.</span>
year and signed by twenty-one persons, which accused
him of military prejudice against civil liberties, and of discouraging
the Protestants and their religion. It asked for
a new governor of a less military type, and for a House
of Representatives composed of Protestants alone, though
Roman Catholics might be allowed to vote for Protestant
members. Never did a small minority make more extravagant
claims, or attack with greater want of scruple those
who were trying to hold the balance even.</p>

<p>Carleton succeeded Murray, and soon after his arrival
showed that he was as little disposed, as Murray had been,
to submit to dictation. A side issue had arisen as to the
appointment and precedence of members of the council,
and, in answer to a protest addressed to him by some of
the councillors, he laid down that ‘I will ask the advice
and opinion of such persons, though not of the council, as
I shall find men of good sense, truth, candour, and impartial
justice; persons who prefer their duty to the King,
and the tranquillity of his subjects to unjustifiable
attachments, party zeal, and to all selfish mercenary
views.... I must also remind you that His Majesty’s
service requires tranquillity and peace in his province of
Quebec, and that it is the indispensable duty of every
good subject, and of every honest man, to promote so
desirable an end.’<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Still intrigue went on: religious
bitterness did not abate, as men spoke and wrote on either
side: legal confusion became worse confounded, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
reports were made on what was and what ought to be the
state of the law, by the English law officers of the Crown,
by a delegate sent out from England, and by Masères,
the Attorney-General in Canada. One crying evil, however, <span class="sidenote">The ordinance of 1770.</span>
arising from the proceedings for the recovery of debts,
which were enriching magistrates and bailiffs and reducing
Canadian families to beggary, was remedied by Carleton
in an ordinance dated 1st February, 1770, which among
other provisions deprived the justices of the peace of
jurisdiction in cases affecting private property.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> It was
a righteous ordinance, and those who had profited by the
old system raised an outcry against it, but in vain. Eventually <span class="sidenote">The Quebec Act.</span>
the Quebec Act was passed in 1774, the provisions
of which must now be considered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its
objects.</div>

<p>‘The principal objects of the Quebec Bill,’ we read in
the <i>Annual Register</i> for 1774,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> ‘were to ascertain the
limits of that province, which were extended far beyond
what had been settled as such by the King’s Proclamation
of 1763. To form a legislative council for all the affairs
of that province, except taxation, which council should
be appointed by the Crown, the office to be held during
pleasure; and His Majesty’s Roman Catholic subjects
were entitled to a place in it. To establish the French
laws, and a trial without jury, in civil cases: and the
English laws, with a trial by jury, in criminal; to secure
to the Roman Catholic clergy, except the Regulars, the
legal enjoyment of their estates, and of their tythes from
all who were of their own religion. These were the chief
objects of the Act.’</p>

<p>It has been seen that, under the Proclamation of 1763,
the province of Quebec included the settled part of Canada,<span class="sidenote">Extension of the boundaries of the province of Quebec.</span>
as far as the point where the 45th parallel of latitude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
intersected the St. Lawrence, midway between Montreal
and Lake Ontario. Outside the province were the
Labrador coast from the river St. John to Hudson Straits,
which, with the island of Anticosti and other small islands
in the estuary of the St. Lawrence, was placed ‘under the
care and inspection’ of the Governor of Newfoundland;
the government of Nova Scotia, including at the time Cape
Breton Island, the territory now forming the province of
New Brunswick, and the island of St. John, afterwards
Prince Edward Island; the territories of the Hudson’s
Bay Company; and the great undefined region of the
lakes and the Ohio as far as the Mississippi. The Quebec
Act restored to Canada or, as it was still styled, the province
of Quebec, the Labrador coast and Anticosti, and
included in it, within the lines which the Act prescribed,
the Western territories for which England and France
had fought so hard.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Labrador
coast
added to
the province
of
Quebec.</div>

<p>The reason for re-annexing the Labrador coast to Canada
was that since 1763, when it had been placed under the
Governor of Newfoundland, there had been constant
disputes and difficulties as to the fishing rights on that
coast. It was the old story, so well known in the case of
Newfoundland itself, of a perpetual struggle between
those who lived on or near the spot, and the fishermen
who came over the Atlantic from English ports, and who
wanted the fisheries and the landing-places reserved for
their periodical visits. The Governor of Newfoundland
in the years 1764-8 was an energetic man, Sir Hugh
Palliser, who built a fort in Labrador, and set himself to
enforce the fishing rules which prevailed in Newfoundland.
But the Labrador fisheries, it was contended, were of a
more sedentary nature than those of the Newfoundland
Banks, sealing was as prominent an occupation as cod-fishing;<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
the regulations which kept Newfoundland for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
the Dorset and Devon fishing fleets could not fairly be
applied to the mainland, and the coast of Labrador should
be placed under regular civil government, and not be left
in the charge of the sea captains who held authority in
Newfoundland.</p>

<p>It was really a case, on a very small scale, of England
against America; and the interesting point to notice is
that the opponents of the Newfoundland régime included
alike French Canadians and New Englanders. The few
settlers on the Labrador coast, and the fishermen and
sealers who came either from Canada or from the New
England states, were all concerned to prevent Labrador
from being kept, like Newfoundland, as a preserve for
Englishmen, and a nursery for English sailors; and it
illustrates the confusion of thought which existed among
the opponents of the Quebec Act that, in the debate on
the Act, we find Chatham, the champion of the rights of
the American colonists, denouncing the provision which
gave back Labrador to Quebec, on the ground that it
would become a nursery for French instead of English
sailors, forgetful that the system which he wished to perpetuate,
had been persistently obstructed by the men of
Massachusetts, forgetful too that true statesmanship conceived
of the French Canadians, on sea or land, as future
loyal citizens of the British Crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inclusion

<p  class="pbot1">But the extension of the boundaries of the province of
Quebec on the Atlantic side was after all a small matter,
though the most was made of it for party purposes.
Nor could exception be taken to the enlargement of the
province to the north and north-west, until it reached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
the territories which had been granted to, or were claimed
by, the Hudson’s Bay Company. Far more important
and more debatable was the inclusion of the western and
south-western regions, which had been left outside the
government of Quebec by the Proclamation of 1763.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="p1">It will be remembered<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> that these territories had not
been included in the province of Quebec for three reasons:
that their incorporation with the conquered province
might have been held to be an admission that the British
title to them only dated from the conquest of Canada,
that their annexation to any particular province would
have given to that province a preponderating advantage
in regard to trade with the Indians, and that the extension
to them of the laws and administration of the province of
Quebec would have necessitated the establishment of a
number of military garrisons throughout the territories.
The first of these three objections was, in fact, taken in the
debates on the Quebec Bill. ‘The first object of the Bill,’
said Mr. Dunning in the House of Commons on the 26th
of May, 1774, ‘is to make out that to be<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Canada, which
it was the struggle of this country to say, was not Canada.’
The second objection was clearly potent in the minds of
the partisans of the old British colonies, who opposed the
Bill. It would seem that when the Proclamation of 1763
was issued, the British Government had contemplated
passing an Act of Parliament, constituting a separate
administration for the Western territories, but the plan,
whatever it was, never came to the birth;<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> and, as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
King had foreseen, ‘great inconvenience’ had arisen ‘from
so large a tract of land being left, without being subject to
the civil jurisdiction of some governor’.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> This inconvenience
the Quebec Act tried to rectify by bringing
these western lands under the government of Canada.</p>

<p>The line now laid down, on the motion of Burke in the
House of Commons, was carried from the point where
the 45th parallel of latitude intersected the St. Lawrence
to Lake Ontario, up Lake Ontario and the Niagara river
into Lake Erie, and along the southern or eastern shore of
Lake Erie, until it met the alleged frontier of the state
of Pennsylvania, or, if that frontier was found not to
touch the lake, up to the point nearest to the north-western
angle of Pennsylvania. From that angle it
skirted the western boundary of Pennsylvania down to
the Ohio, which river it followed to the Mississippi.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Claims of
Pennsylvania.</div>

<p>In the debate in the House of Commons a petition was
presented from the Penns, claiming that part of the
province of Pennsylvania was situated to the north-west
of the Ohio, and Lord North offered no opposition to the
petition, on the ground that the Bill was not intended
to affect existing rights. On a map of 1776, after the
passing of the Act, Pennsylvania was shown as jutting
out at an acute angle into Lake Erie, and the boundary
line, identical with the western frontier of the state, started
from the lake near Presque Isle, and struck the Ohio at
Logs Town, west of Fort Duquesne and slightly east of
Beaver Creek, leaving to Pennsylvania the whole course
of the Alleghany, and Fort Duquesne or Pittsburg. It
will be noted that, further east, the line, being drawn
along the St. Lawrence and the lakes, excluded from
Canada the whole country of the Six Nations, which had
been demarcated as Indian Territory by the Agreement
of 1768.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> The net result was to leave the boundary line<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
south of the St. Lawrence, where it had been drawn in
1763, as far as the intersection of the 45th parallel with
the river, and thence to follow the waterways up to the
point in the southern shore of Lake Erie where the old
French route to the Ohio left the lake. From the Atlantic
up to this point the present international line between
Canada and the United States is not far different at the
present day, though more favourable to the United States,
especially where, since the Ashburton Treaty of 1842, the
state of Maine runs northward into the provinces of
Quebec and New Brunswick. But, by carrying the boundary
from Lake Erie to the Ohio and down the Ohio to
the Mississippi, all the Illinois country and all the western
lands, for which English and French had contended, were
confirmed to Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons
for the
extension
of the
province.</div>

<p>There were good reasons for taking this step. Eleven
years had passed since the territories in question had been
left as an Indian reserve. Events move quickly in a
border land, and encroachments grow apace. The time
had come for some defined system, some recognized law
and government. As far as there were permanent settlers
in these regions, they were, it would seem, although the
contrary was averred in the House of Commons, French
rather than English; and it would be more palatable for
colonists of French origin to be incorporated with Canada
than to be absorbed by the purely English colonies. The
native population would unquestionably be better cared
for under the government of Quebec than under the
legislatures of Pennsylvania and Virginia. The waterways
still, as in old times, made communication easier
from Canada than from the southern colonies; and to
those colonies, on the brink of war against the mother
country, the mother country could hardly be expected to
entrust the keeping of the West.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Arguments
urged
against it.</div>

<p>On the other hand there was bitter and intelligible
opposition to the annexation to Canada of ‘immense
territories, now desert, but which are the best parts of
that continent and which run on the back of all your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
ancient colonies’.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The decision which was now taken
meant cutting off the existing English colonies from the
West; and, in view of the other provisions of the Act, the
incorporation of the new territories with Canada placed
them under an administration in which there was at the
time no element of self-government and which gave
formal recognition to the Roman Catholic Church. It was,
in short, or seemed to be, an admission that the old claim
of Canada to the regions of the Ohio, against which,
while Canada was still a French possession, the British
Government and the British colonies had alike contended,
was after all a valid claim; and it was, or seemed to be,
a pronouncement that in years to come the future of the
Western lands was to be shaped on Canadian principles
and Canadian traditions, rather than on those which had
moulded and inspired the ever-growing colonies of the
British race.</p>

<p>It has been argued that true statesmanship would, in
accordance with the plan which had been at one time
contemplated, have constituted the territories beyond the
45th parallel a separate province under the Crown,
separate alike from Canada on the one hand, and from
Pennsylvania and Virginia on the other. This might
possibly have been a preferable course; but, as subsequent
experience showed in the case of Upper Canada, an inland
colony, whose only outlet is through other provinces, is
always in a difficult position; and the multiplication of
communities in North America had already borne a crop
of difficulties. Moreover, the particular circumstances of
the time accounted for the decision which was taken, as
they accounted also for the strong antagonism which that
decision called forth. In the same session in which the
Quebec Act was passed, the British Parliament had already
enacted three punitive laws against the recalcitrant
colony of Massachusetts; one closing the harbour of
Boston; another altering the legislature, and giving to
the governor the power of appointing and removing the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
judges, magistrates, and sheriffs; and a third empowering
the trial of persons accused of capital offences in the
discharge of their public duties to be held outside the
limits of the province. If it was thought necessary thus
to limit the liberties of one of the English colonies by
Imperial legislation, it would have been hopelessly illogical
to enlarge the borders of others among the sister communities;
and if the only possible alternative was to keep
the Western territories directly under the Crown, it was
simpler, and involved less friction and debate, to attach
them by a single clause in a Bill to the existing province
of Quebec, than to treat them as a separate unit and to
provide them with an administration and a legislature by
a separate law. Furthermore, their annexation to Canada
outwardly, at any rate, strengthened at a critical time the
one province in America where the Crown still held undivided
sway.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sections
in the
Act
which
dealt
with the
religious
question.</div>

<p>The fifth, sixth, and seventh sections of the Act dealt
with religion. They provided for the free exercise of
the Roman Catholic faith by the members of that Church,
subject to the King’s supremacy as established by the
Act passed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth; but they
substituted a simple oath of allegiance for the oath required
by Queen Elizabeth’s statute, and they confirmed
to the Roman Catholic clergy ‘their accustomed dues
and rights’. Protestants were expressly exempted from
these payments; but the Act provided that, from such
dues as they would otherwise have paid, provision might be
made for the encouragement of the Protestant religion
and the maintenance of a Protestant clergy. In other
words, freedom of religion was guaranteed, the establishment
of the Roman Catholic Church was recognized
by law, and the principle of concurrent endowment was
introduced.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other
provisions
of
the Act.</div>

<p>The eighth section of the Act restored Canadian law
and custom in civil matters, and confirmed existing rights
to property, with the exception of the property of the
religious orders. The eleventh section continued the law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
of England in criminal matters. The twelfth, laying down
that it was at present inexpedient to call an Assembly, provided
for a nominated Legislative Council, consisting of
not more than twenty-three and not less than seventeen
members, no religious test being imposed. The next
section withheld from the council the power of taxation,
such additional taxes as were deemed necessary being
imposed by a separate Act of the Imperial Parliament.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Act
embodied
a compromise.</div>

<p>Such were the principal provisions of the Quebec Act.
It embodied a fair and reasonable compromise. In part
the Government retraced their steps; they restored
Canadian civil law, they postponed indefinitely a representative
legislature, but they gave what could under the
circumstances be suitably and prudently given, religious
toleration, trial by jury in criminal matters, and a council
to which the Crown could call representatives of all creeds
and interests. The Bill was attacked in the House of <span class="sidenote">Opposition to it.</span>
Lords, and in the House of Commons; and, even after it
had become law, in 1775, Lord Camden in the House of
Lords, and Sir George Savile in the House of Commons,
presented petitions from the British inhabitants of the
province of Quebec against the Act and moved for its
repeal. The corporation of London petitioned against it.
The American colonists made it the text of the manifesto
to the people of Canada, which has already been noticed.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
In the debates in Parliament various points were taken.
Fox argued that, as the Bill gave tithes to the Roman
Catholic clergy, it was a money Bill, and should not have
originated, as it did originate in the House of Lords.
Others criticized the absence of any provision for the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
rights of Habeas Corpus,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and the abolition of trial by
jury in civil cases; but the main attack was on the lines
that the law gave formal recognition to the Roman
Catholic Church, that it withheld popular representation,
and that it extended these two unsound principles to new
territories whose lot should rather have been cast with
the English colonies. Reference was made to the case of
the colony of Grenada, in which limited representation
in the popular Assembly had been given to Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
Catholics; but the opponents of the Quebec Act had not
the courage to declare for a popular Assembly for Canada,
without any religious test, for it would have meant an
almost exclusively Roman Catholic legislature. They <span class="sidenote">Inconsistency of the opponents.</span>
were at one and the same time fighting for the Protestant
minority and contending for popular representation, but
Protestant claims and popular representation in Canada
were hopelessly at variance. This made the case of the
opposition weak, and this was the justification of the Act.
Lord Chatham denounced it as a most cruel, oppressive,
and odious measure. Burke tried to appeal to popular
prejudice against the Canadian seigniors. He attacked
them, and he pressed the claims of the Protestant minority
on the ground of their commercial importance, descending
to such clap-trap as that in his opinion, in the case in point,
one Englishman was worth fifty Frenchmen. The tone
of the opposition was unworthy of the men, but minds had
been so embittered and judgements so clouded by years of
wrangle and debate on the American question, that the
Act for the better government of Canada was viewed by
the opponents of the ministry and the partisans of the
colonies mainly as a case of French against English, and
Papists against Protestants. None the less, the Act was
a just and generous measure, and, when Carleton returned
to Canada in September, 1774, his reception by the leading
French Canadians showed that they appreciated it.
Because, when war came, the Canadians as a whole stood
aloof in a quarrel which was no concern of theirs, and
some of them joined the revolting colonies, it was argued
in the English Parliament that the Act had not conciliated
them, and therefore stood condemned; but history has
proved that this view was not true. No one measure or
series of measures can at once obliterate differences of race,
language, and creed; but, passed as it was at a time of
failures, recrimination, and bitterness, the Quebec Act
stood and will to all times stand to the credit of English
good sense, in dealing with the actual facts of a difficult
position, and the feelings and prejudices of an alien people.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="label">[29]</a> It is very difficult to state the case quite fairly as between the
mother country and the colonies. In the first place a broad distinction
must be drawn between the New England colonies and the more
southern colonies. The New Englanders, who had the French on their
borders, made far more sacrifices in men and money than the southern
colonies, some of which, owing to remoteness, took no part in the
war. The efforts of Massachusetts, and the military expenditure
incurred by that colony, are set out by Mr. Parkman in his <i>Montcalm
and Wolfe</i>, 1884 ed., vol. ii, chap. xx, pp. 83-6. In the next place,
the regular regiments, though the whole expense of them was borne
by the mother country, were to a considerable extent recruited in
the colonies. The Royal Americans, e.g. were entirely composed of
colonists. At the second siege of Louisbourg the English force consisted,
according to Parkman, of 11,600 men, of whom only 500 were
provincial troops, and according to Kingsford of 12,260, of whom five
companies only were Rangers. The expedition against Ticonderoga,
excluding bateau men and non-combatants, included, according to
Kingsford, 6,405 regulars and 5,960 provincials. Parkman gives 6,367
regulars and 9,034 provincials; this was before the actual advance
began, and probably included bateau men, &amp;c. Forbes’ army contained
1,630 regulars out of a total of 5,980 (Kingsford). Wolfe’s
force at Quebec, in 1759, numbered 8,535 combatants, out of whom
the provincial troops only amounted to about 700 (Kingsford. See
also Parkman’s <i>Montcalm and Wolfe</i>, Appendix H). Amherst, in the
same year, in the campaign on Lakes George and Champlain, commanded
6,537 Imperial troops and 4,839 provincials. [The respective
numbers in the different forces are well summed up in the fifth volume
of Kingsford’s <i>History of Canada</i>, pp. 273-4.]</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="label">[57]</a> The opponents of the Quebec Act maintained that it took away
the right of Habeas Corpus. Thus petitions from English residents
in Quebec, dated November 12, 1774, complained, in respect to the
Quebec Act, ‘That in matters of a Criminal Nature the Habeas Corpus
Act is dissolved:’ and again, ‘That to their inexpressible grief they
find, by an Act of Parliament entitled an act for making more effectual
provision for the government of the province of Quebec in North
America, they are deprived of the Habeas Corpus Act and trial by
juries:’ and again, ‘an Act of Parliament which deprives His Majesty’s
ancient subjects of all their rights and franchises, destroys the Habeas
Corpus Act and the inestimable privilege of trial by juries’ (Shortt
and Doughty, pp. 414-18). The Government on the other hand contended
that before the Quebec Act, the Statute of Habeas Corpus was
not in force in Canada, although, both before and after the Act, the
Common Law right existed. Thus Wedderburn, the Solicitor-General,
before the Quebec Act was drafted but while the subject matter was
being considered by the Government, reported, ‘It is recommended
by the Governor, the Chief Justice, and the Attorney-General, in
their report, to extend the provisions of the Habeas Corpus Act to
Canada. The inhabitants will, of course, be entitled to the benefit
of the writ of Habeas Corpus at Common Law, but it may be proper
to be better assured of their fidelity and attachment, before the provisions
of the statute are extended to that country’ (Ib. 300); and
in November, 1783, Governor Haldimand reported that he was going
to propose an ordinance for introducing the Habeas Corpus Act, ‘which
will remove one of the ill-grounded objections to the Quebec Act, for
though that law had never been introduced into the province, people
were taught to believe that the Quebec Act had deprived the inhabitants
of the benefit of it’ (Ib. 499). The point at issue, and it is not free
from doubt, was whether the introduction <i>en bloc</i> of the English criminal
law into Canada, brought with it <i>ipso facto</i> the introduction of the
Habeas Corpus statute. Haldimand passed his ordinance in 1784
under the title of an ‘Act for securing the liberty of the subject and
for the prevention of imprisonments out of this province’. The preamble
stated that ‘The Legislature could not follow a better example
than that which the Common Law of England hath set in the provision
made for a writ of Habeas Corpus which is the right of every British
subject in that kingdom’.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE WAR OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">Ticonderoga
and
Crown
Point.</div>

<p>The War of American Independence began with the
skirmish at Lexington on the 19th of April, 1775. The
battle of Bunker’s Hill was fought on the following 16th
of June. Between these two dates a forward move was
made towards Canada by the American colonists, and the
forts of Ticonderoga and Crown Point on Lake Champlain
were surprised and taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carleton
urges the
upkeep of
strong
forts in
North
America.</div>

<p>Years before, shortly after taking over the administration
of Canada, Carleton had called attention to the
dilapidated condition of these forts. In a letter, dated
the 15th of February, 1767,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> he wrote to General Gage,
then Commander-in-Chief in North America—‘the forts of
Crown Point, Ticonderoga, and Fort George are in a very
declining condition, of which, I believe, your Excellency
is well informed. Should you approve of keeping up
these posts, it will be best to repair them as soon as
possible.’ The letter went on to suggest that, in addition
to repairing the forts in question, there should be ‘a
proper place of arms near the town of New York and a
citadel in or near the town of Quebec’, the object being to
secure communication with the mother country and to
link the two provinces together. Written in view of
‘the state of affairs on this continent’, the letter was
statesmanlike and farseeing in a high degree. The writer
argued that ‘the natural and political situation of the
provinces of Quebec and New York is such as must for
ever give them great influence and weight in the American
system’. He pleaded, therefore, for strong forts at
Quebec and New York, and strong posts on the line
between New York and Canada. Thus, in the event of
war breaking out, the King’s magazines would be kept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
secure, the northern colonies would be separated from the <span class="sidenote">Carleton’s policy: (1) adequate defences
and garrisons: (2) attachment of the Canadians to the British Crown especially by giving them employment under the government.</span>
southern, and delay in transport and difficulty of communication,
so dangerous, especially in the early stages
of a war, would be averted. In the years which preceded
the War of American Independence, Carleton had constantly
in view the twofold contingency of war with
France and war with the British colonies in America;
and there were two cardinal points in his policy, which he
never ceased to impress upon the Home Government, on
the one hand the necessity for adequate military forces,
and adequate forts in America, on the other the necessity
for taking such steps as would attach the Canadians to
the British Crown.</p>

<p>In November, 1767,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> he wrote to Shelburne, ‘The town
of Quebec is the only post in this province that has the
least claim to be called a fortified place; for the flimsy
wall about Montreal, was it not falling to ruins, could only
turn musketry.’ He went on to show how the French
officers who still remained in Canada, and the Canadian
seigniors who had served France, had lost their employment
through the conquest of Canada, and, not having
been taken into the English King’s service, had no motive
to be ‘active in the defence of a people that has deprived
them of their honours, privileges, profits, and laws’;
and again he urged the importance of building a citadel,
for which he enclosed a plan, within the town of Quebec.
‘A work of this nature,’ he wrote, ‘is not only necessary
as matters now stand, but supposing the Canadians
could be interested to take a part in the defence of the
King’s Government, a change not impossible to bring
about, yet time must bring forth events that will render it
essentially necessary for the British interests on this continent
to secure this port of communication with the
mother country.’</p>

<p>In January, 1868,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> he wrote again to Shelburne, and
referring to his previous letter and to the scheme for constructing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
a citadel at Quebec, he said—‘Was this already
constructed, and I could suppose it impossible for any
foreign enemy to shake the King’s dominion over the
province, still I shall think the interests of Great Britain
but half advanced, unless the Canadians are inspired with
a cordial attachment and zeal for the King’s Government.’
Once more he urged that the Canadians had no motive
of self-interest to attach them to British rule. The laws
and customs which affected their property had been overturned.
Justice was slow and expensive. The different
offices claimed ‘as their right, fees calculated for much
wealthier provinces’; and the leading Canadians were
excluded from all places of trust and profit. Give the
people back their old laws and customs in civil matters, let
them feel thereby secure in their property, take a few
Canadians into the service of the Crown, enlist in the
King’s forces ‘a few companies of Canadian foot, judiciously
officered’, ‘hold up hopes to the gentlemen, that
their children, without being bred up in France, or in the
French service, might support their families in the service
of the King their master,’ and, at any rate, some proportion
of the French Canadians would be found loyally attached
to the British Government.</p>

<p>Another letter, written to Lord Hillsborough in
November, 1768,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> was in similar terms. It referred to
rumours of French intrigues and of a contemplated rising
on the part of the Canadian gentry. Carleton discredited
the rumours, but added, ‘Notwithstanding this, and their
decent and respectful obedience to the King’s Government
hitherto, I have not the least doubt of their secret attachment
to France, and think this will continue, as long as
they are excluded from all employments under the British
Government.’ He reflected ‘that France naturally has
the affections of all the people: that, to make no mention
of fees of office and of the vexations of the law, we have
done nothing to gain one man in the province, by making
it his private interest to remain the King’s subject’. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
went on to point out that ‘the King’s dominion here is
maintained but by a few troops, necessarily dispersed,
without a place of security for their magazines, for their
arms, or for themselves, amidst a numerous military
people, the gentlemen all officers of experience, poor,
without hopes that they or their descendants will be
admitted into the service of their present Sovereign’, and
he argued that, were a war with France to coincide with a
rising of the British colonies in North America, the danger
to the British power would be great. ‘Canada, probably,
will then become the principal scene, where the fate of
America may be determined.’ On the other hand he urged—‘How
greatly Canada might for ever support the
British interests on this continent, for it is not united in
any common principle, interest, or wish with the other
provinces, in opposition to the supreme seat of government,
was the King’s dominion over it only strengthened by
a citadel, which a few national troops might secure, and
the natives attached by making it their interest to remain
his subjects.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carleton’s
sympathy
with the
French
Canadians.</div>

<p>In the second of these letters<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> from which quotations
have been made, Carleton said that he would endeavour
to represent the true situation of the province to the
ministers at home, who were already engaged in considering
‘the improvement of the civil constitution of
Quebec’, lest the King’s servants, with all their ability,
should be at a disadvantage in forming their conclusions
‘for want of having truly represented to them objects at
so great a distance, and in themselves so different from
what is to be found in any other of his dominions’. But
it was not merely a case of the man on the spot advising
the men at a distance; the value of Carleton’s advice was
largely due to the fact of his being a soldier. To this
fact must be attributed, in great measure, the strong
sympathy which the soldier-governors felt with the French
Canadians, and on Carleton’s part more especially with
the French Canadian gentry. As Murray had pointed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
out,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> the Canadians were a people of soldiers; they were
<span class="sidenote">The French Canadians were a people of soldiers accustomed to personal rule.</span>
accustomed to personal rule and attachment rather than
to the rule of the law. To high minded English officers,
themselves brought up in the King’s service, trained to
discipline, to well ordered grades of obedience, the old
Canadian system with its feudal customs was congenial
and attractive, and they resented attempts to substitute
for it the beginnings of undisciplined democracy. Hence
Carleton laid stress on taking Canadian gentlemen into
the government service, and on enlisting companies of
Canadian soldiers, in other words, on making the Canadians
feel that they were, as they had been in past times, the
King’s men. Hence, too, we find him in a letter to
Shelburne of April, 1768,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> recommending full recognition
and continuance of the old feudal tenures of Canada,
including ‘a formal requisition of all those immediately
holding of the King, to pay faith and homage to him at
his castle of St. Lewis’. If left to himself, he would have
liked to repeal entirely the Ordinance of September, 1764,
which introduced English laws into Canada, ‘and for the
present leave the Canadian laws almost entire;’<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> and,
though he assented to the compromise embodied in the
Quebec Act, whereby the criminal law was to be that of
England, while in civil matters Canadian law and custom
were in the main to prevail, we find him in June, 1775,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
after war had begun, writing to Dartmouth, ‘For my part,
since my return to this province I have seen good cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
to repent my ever having recommended the Habeas
Corpus Act and English criminal laws.’</p>

<p>It was due to Carleton that the Ordinance of 1770, to
which reference has already been made,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> was passed,
taking away from the justices of the peace jurisdiction
in matters of private property which had been exercised
to the detriment of the French Canadians. It was due to
him that in 1771 a new Royal Instruction was issued,
authorizing the governor to revert to the old French
system of grants of Crown lands ‘in Fief or Seigneurie’;<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
and his influence was all in favour of the clauses in the
Quebec Act which were favourable to the ‘new subjects’,
the French Canadians, who, at the time when the War of
American Independence began, seem to have numbered
under 100,000.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Carleton
returns
from
England
in September,
1774, and
sends two
regiments
to Boston.</div>

<p>As has been told, Carleton came back from England to
Quebec in the middle of September, 1774, finding the
French Canadians in great good humour at the passing of
the Quebec Act. Twenty hours after his arrival an
express letter reached him from General Gage, still Commander-in-Chief
in North America, who was then at
Boston.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> In it Gage asked his colleague to send at once
to Boston, if they could be spared, the 10th and 52nd
Regiments, which formed a large part of the scanty garrison
of Canada. The transports which brought the letter
were to take back the troops. September, 1774, was a
critical month in the North American provinces. The
first continental Congress met at Philadelphia; and at
Suffolk, near Boston, on the 9th September, a public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
meeting passed resolutions,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> boldly advocating resistance
to the recent Acts of Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proposals
to
raise
Canadian
and
Indian
forces.</div>

<p>Accordingly, in addition to his request for the two
regiments, Gage wrote—‘As I must look forward to the
worst, from the apparent disposition of the people here,
I am to ask your opinion, whether a body of Canadians
and Indians might be collected and confided in, for the
service in this country, should matters come to extremities.’
Carleton promptly replied: ‘Pilots are sent down the
river, the 10th and 52nd shall be ready to embark at a
moment’s notice;’ and the regiments were sent to Boston,
as in later years Lord Lawrence, at the time of the Indian
Mutiny, denuded the Punjaub of soldiers, in order to
strengthen the force which was besieging Delhi. Carleton’s
letter continued: ‘The Canadians have testified to me
the strongest marks of joy and gratitude, and fidelity to
the King, and to his Government, for the late arrangements
made at home in their favour: a Canadian regiment would
complete their happiness, which in time of need might be <span class="sidenote">Carleton strongly favours raising a Canadian regiment.</span>
augmented to two, three, or more battalions ... the
savages of this province, I hear, are in very good humour,
a Canadian battalion would be a great motive and go far
to influence them, but you know what sort of people they
are.’ Here was the opportunity which Carleton desired,
of taking the Canadians into the King’s service. Following
on the Quebec Act, he looked to such a measure as
likely to rivet Canadian loyalty to the British Crown,
and evidently took himself, and inspired the Home Government
with, too hopeful a view of the amount of support
to be expected from the Canadians, looking to and sympathizing
with the seigniors rather than the lower classes
of the people of Canada. It will be noted that both Gage
and he contemplated employing Indians, in the event of
war between the mother country and the North American
colonies. Indians had been used on either side in the
wars with the French, but it seems strange that there is no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
hint or suggestion in these letters of the danger and impolicy
of employing them against the British colonists.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<p>In November, 1774, writing to Dartmouth,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Carleton
still spoke of the gratitude and loyalty of the French
Canadians, but there was a warning note in his letter.
While the respectable members of the English community
at Quebec supported the Government, there was much
disloyalty among the British residents at Montreal.
The resolutions of the Philadelphia Congress, and their
address to the people of Canada, had reached that place.
Walker was much in evidence, embittered by the outrage
which he had suffered some years before,<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> and, with others,
was organizing meetings and petitions both at Montreal
and at Quebec. These proceedings, Carleton wrote, were
causing uneasiness to the Canadians, and he concluded
that ‘Government cannot guard too much, or too soon,
against the consequences of an infection, imported daily,
warmly recommended, and spread abroad by the colonists
here, and indeed by some from Europe, not less violent
than the Americans’.</p>

<p>The year 1774 ended in anxiety and suspense, and the
year 1775 opened, memorable and disastrous to Great
Britain. On Christmas Day, 1774, Gage had written again
to Carleton on the subject of Canadian and Indian levies,
and on the 4th of February, 1775, Carleton answered the
letter.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Political matters relating to the Indians, he said,
<span class="sidenote">Canadian feeling at the beginning of 1775.</span>
he had always considered to be the special charge of the
late Sir William Johnson, and outside the sphere of his
own authority, but his intelligence was to the effect that
the Indians would be ready for service if called upon.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
the Canadians Carleton wrote that they had in general
been made very happy by the passing of the Quebec Act,
but he reminded Gage that that Act did not come into
force until the 1st of May following, that the new commissions
and instructions expected in connexion with it
had not yet arrived, and that the whole machinery for
carrying out the new system of government had still to be
created. ‘Had the present settlement taken place,’ he <span class="sidenote">Carleton strongly urges employing the Canadian gentry in the regular army.</span>
added, ‘when first recommended, it would not have
aroused the jealousy of the other colonies, and had the
appearance of more disinterested favour to the Canadians.’
He pointed out that the gentry, ‘well disposed and heartily
desirous as they are, to serve the Crown, and to serve it
with zeal, when formed into regular corps, do not relish
commanding a bare militia.’ They had not been used to
act as militia officers under the French Government, and
they were further deterred from taking such employment
by recollection of the sudden disbandment of a Canadian
regiment, which had been raised in 1764, and subsequently
broken up, ‘without gratuity or recompense to officers,
who engaged in our service almost immediately after the
cession of the country, or taking any notice of them since,
though they all expected half pay.’<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The habitants,
again, had since the introduction of civil government into
Canada, and in consequence of the little authority which
had been exercised, ‘in a manner emancipated themselves.’
Time and good management would be necessary ‘to recall
them to their ancient habits of obedience and discipline’,
and meanwhile they would be slow to allow themselves to
be suddenly and without preparation embodied into a
militia. Carleton accordingly deprecated attempting to
raise a militia force in Canada and recommended enlisting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
one or two regular battalions of Canadian soldiers. ‘Such
a measure might be of singular use, in finding employment
for, and consequently firmly attaching the gentry to our
interests, in restoring them to a significance they have
lost, and through their means obtaining a further influence
upon the lower class of people, a material service to the
state, besides that of effectually securing many nations of
savages.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Summary
of the
political
conditions
of
Canada
at the beginning
of the
War of
American
Independence.</div>

<p>From the above correspondence we can form some
impression of the state of political feeling in Canada, when
the great revolt of the American colonies began. We
have the picture of a conquered people, accustomed to
a military system, to personal rule, and to feudal laws
and customs. This people had been brought by the fortune
of war under the same flag as covered very democratic
communities, which communities were their immediate
neighbours and had been their traditional rivals. The
few years which had passed since the conquest of Canada
had, with the exception of the Indian rising under Pontiac,
been years of uncomfortable peace and administrative
weakness. The government of the country, which was
the mother country of the old colonies and the ruler of
the new possession, was anxious to curtail expenses as
much as possible, in view of the great expenditure which
had been caused by the Seven Years’ War; to maintain
and, if possible, to emphasize its precarious authority over
the democratic communities of the Atlantic seaboard; and,
on the other hand, in a sense to relax its authority over
Canada, by modifying in the direction of English institutions
the despotism which had prevailed under the old
French régime. The net result was that on the American
continent the Executive, having insufficient force behind
it and in the old colonies no popular goodwill, was
increasingly weak, and the people were more and more
unsettled. The democratic communities became more
democratic, and from those communities individuals
brought themselves and their ideas into the sphere of
French conservatism, adding to the uncertainty and confusion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
which attempts to introduce English laws and
customs had already produced in Canada. The Canadian
gentry under British rule found their occupation gone,
their importance minimized, and no outlet for their military
instincts and aspirations. The peasantry found old
rules relaxed and unaccustomed freedom. Strength was
nowhere in evidence in Canada. The forts were falling
into ruin; the English soldiers were few; there was the
King’s Government without the backing of the King’s men;
the old subjects were a small number of men, of whom a
large proportion were noisy, disloyal, adventurers; the
new subjects were not held in submission, but not admitted
to confidence. On the other hand, the French Canadians
had recent and undeniable evidence of the goodwill of
the British Government in the passing of the Quebec Act.
Their governors, Murray and Carleton, had transparently
shown their sympathies with the French Canadian race,
its traditions, and even its prejudices. Amid many inconveniences,
and with some solid grounds for discontent, the
Canadians had none the less tasted British freedom since
the cession of Canada; and they had not yet imbibed it to
such an extent as to overcome their traditional animosity
to, and their inveterate suspicion of, the militant Protestants
of the old colonies who were rising against the King.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary for the purposes of this book to give
a full account of the War of American Independence,
except so far as Canada was immediately concerned.
Here the Americans appeared in the character of invaders,
and the issue really depended upon the attitude of the
French Canadians. Would they rise against their recent
conquerors and join hands with the rebellious colonists,
or would their confidence in Carleton, coupled with their
long standing antipathy to the British settlers in America,
keep them in allegiance to the British Crown? For the
moment all went well for the Americans.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Green
Mountain
rising.</div>

<p>It was characteristic of the state of unrest which prevailed
at this time in America that, while the colonies
as a whole were quarrelling with the mother country, one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
portion of a colony was declaring its independence of the
state to which it was supposed to belong. On the eastern
side of Lake Champlain were a number of settlers who
had come in under grants issued by the Governor of New
Hampshire, but over whom the government and legislature
of New York claimed jurisdiction, the New York
claim having moreover been upheld by the Imperial
Government. These settlers were known at the time as
the ‘Green Mountain Boys’, and they were the nucleus
of the present state of Vermont. In April, 1775, they
held a meeting to declare their independence of New
York, their leaders being Ethan Allen, who had been proclaimed <span class="sidenote">Ethan Allen.</span>
an outlaw by the Governor of New York in the
previous year, and Seth Warner. They had already
apparently in their minds the possibility of taking possession
of the forts on Lake Champlain. There were few men <span class="sidenote">Capture of Ticonderoga and Crown Point.</span>
at Ticonderoga and Crown Point, only about fifty at the
former and half a dozen or so at the latter, belonging to the
26th Regiment, enough and no more than sufficient to guard
the guns and the stores. The garrison apprehended no
attack and had made no preparations for defence.</p>

<p>The news of Lexington suggested to the Green Mountain
Boys to commend themselves to Congress by at once
securing these two forts. If they had any instructions
in planning their expedition, those instructions seem to
have come from Connecticut; and though, before a start
was made, Benedict Arnold was sent up by Congress to
take the matter in hand, the insurgents refused his
leadership; and, while he accompanied the expedition,
it was Allen who mainly carried out the enterprise.
Under Allen’s command, on the night of the 9th of May,
a band of armed men, variously estimated at from under
100 to over 200 in number, marched to the shore of the
Lake Champlain, where it narrows to little more than
a river immediately opposite Ticonderoga; and, crossing
over in two parties, early on the morning of the 10th were
admitted to the fort on pretence of bringing a message
to the commandant, overpowered the guard, and surprised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
the rest of the little garrison in their beds. Two
days later Crown Point was secured by Seth Warner;
and shortly afterwards, under the command of Arnold,
part of the expedition made their way in a captured
schooner to the northern end of the lake, took prisoners
a dozen men who represented the garrison at the fort of
St. John’s, seized a vessel belonging to the Government
which was lying off the fort, and retreated up the lake
on the approach of a detachment from Montreal.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Thus the old fighting route by the way of Lakes George
and Champlain, the scene of numberless raids and counter-raids,
where Robert Rogers, William Johnson, Montcalm,
Abercromby, Amherst, and many others had played their
parts, passed into the hands of the revolutionary party,
and only the forts of St. John’s and Chambly, beyond
the outlet of Lake Champlain, barred the way to Montreal.
The British power in Canada seemed gone to nothingness,
and at the beginning of June, in reporting to Dartmouth
what had taken place, Carleton wrote: ‘We are equally
unprepared for attack or defence; not six hundred rank
and file fit for duty upon the whole extent of this great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
river,<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> not an armed vessel, no place of strength; the
ancient provincial force enervated and broke to pieces;
all subordination overset, and the minds of the people
poisoned by the same hypocrisy and lies practised with
so much success in the other provinces.’<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>The gentry and clergy, he reported, had shown zeal and
loyalty in the King’s service, but they had lost much of
their influence over the people, and the Indians had been
as backward as the peasantry in rallying to the defence
of Canada. The crisis had come, and Carleton’s warnings
of past years had been amply justified. Absence of military
preparations, and neglect to take measures to attach
the Canadians to the British Crown had resulted in a situation
full of danger, a province open to invasion, a government
without material for defence, and a confused and
half-hearted people. Even Carleton’s forecast had not
been wholly accurate. He seems to have over-rated the <span class="sidenote">Miscalculations as to Canadian feeling.</span>
good effects of passing the Quebec Act, and not to have
fully realized the strength of class feeling in Canada, or
the extent to which the peasantry, under the influence of
the disloyal British minority and of emissaries from the
revolting colonies, had emancipated themselves from the
control of the seigniors and the gentry. It was even suggested
that the lower orders in the province, instead of
being grateful for the Quebec Act, regarded it with suspicion
and dislike, as intended to restore a feudal authority
which they had repudiated, and such no doubt would have
been the doctrine taught by the British malcontents inside
and outside the province. ‘What will be your lordship’s
astonishment,’ wrote Hey, the Chief Justice of Canada, to
the Lord Chancellor, towards the end of the following
August,<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> ‘when I tell you that an Act passed for the
express purpose of gratifying the Canadians, and which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
was supposed to comprehend all that they either wished
or wanted, is become the first object of their discontent
and dislike. English officers to command them in time
of war, and English laws to govern them in time of peace,
is the general wish. The former they know to be impossible
(at least at present), and by the latter, if I understand
them right, they mean no laws and no government whatsoever.
In the meantime, it may be truly said that
General Carleton has taken an ill measure of the influence
of the seigniors and clergy over the lower order of people.’
If Carleton had misjudged the feelings of the Canadians,
the Chief Justice frankly admitted that he himself had
been fully as much deceived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mistakes
of the
Home
Government.</div>

<p>The mischief was that the Government in England had
imbibed the confident anticipations of Canadian loyalty
which had been formed by the men on the spot immediately
after the passing of the Quebec Act; and, instead of
sending reinforcements to Canada, they expected Carleton
to reinforce Gage’s army in New England. On the 1st of
July, Dartmouth wrote to Carleton, instructing him to
raise a body of 3,000 Canadians to co-operate with Gage;
on the 24th of July, having had further news from America,
he doubled the number and authorized a levy of 6,000
Canadians; and no hope was given of sending British
troops to Canada until the following spring. At the beginning
of the American war the greatest danger to the
British Empire consisted in the utter weakness of the
position in Canada. It was some excuse, no doubt, for
the ministers at home that the Governor of Canada had
latterly over-estimated the loyalty of the Canadians;
and it may well have been too that the dispatch of troops
to the St. Lawrence was delayed in order not to alarm the
American colonies, before they openly revolted, and while
there was still some faint hope of peace, by a measure which
might have been interpreted as a threat of war. But those
who were responsible for the safe keeping of British interests
in America stand condemned in the light of the repeated
warnings which Carleton had given in previous years.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
As a skilled soldier, he had pointed out, and history confirmed,
the vital importance of Canada in the event of war
in America, its commanding position for military purposes
in relation to the other<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> provinces. He had urged the
necessity of military strength in Canada, of strength
which was both actual and apparent; of forts strong
enough to be defended and of British soldiers numerous
enough to defend them; moreover, of forts strong enough
and British soldiers numerous enough to at once compel
and attract the attachment of a military people. As a
statesman, he had recommended more than a Quebec Act,
years before the Quebec Act was passed. Political and
financial exigencies outside Canada may have made it
impossible to take his guidance, but had it been followed,
the whole course of history might have been changed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carleton
moves
troops to
St. John’s.</div>

<p>On hearing of the capture of the forts on Lake Champlain,
Carleton took what measures he could. He moved
all his available troops, including some Canadian volunteers,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
to St. John’s, and strengthened its defences. He
went up himself from Quebec to Montreal, where he
arrived on the 26th of May. On the 9th of June he called
out the Canadian militia under the old French law, with
little effect beyond causing irritation and discontent,
which American emissaries and sympathizers turned to
account; and on the 2nd of August he went back to
Quebec, to summon the first Legislative Council which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
was constituted under the Quebec Act, that Act having
now come into operation. Meanwhile, after the battle of
Bunker’s Hill, the American Congress had resolved on
invading Canada in force; General Philip Schuyler was
placed in charge of the expedition, but, his health giving
way, the command devolved upon Richard Montgomery, <span class="sidenote">The Americans under Richard Montgomery invade Canada.</span>
who had served under Amherst throughout the campaign
which ended with the conquest of Canada, and had subsequently
settled in the state of New York and married an
American lady.</p>

<p>At the beginning of September, the American troops
moved northward down Lake Champlain, and took up a
position at the Isle aux Noix, twelve miles from the fort
at St. John’s, preparatory to besieging that fort. ‘The
rebels are returned into this province in great numbers,
well provided with everything, and seemingly resolved to
make themselves masters of this province. Hardly a
Canadian will take arms to oppose them, and I doubt all
we have to trust to is about 500 men and two small forts
at St. John’s. Everything seems to be desperate,’ so
wrote Chief Justice Hey from Quebec to the Lord Chancellor
on the 11th of September.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> On the 17th he added,
‘The rebels have succeeded in making peace with the
savages who have all left the camp at St. John’s, many
of the Canadians in that neighbourhood are in arms against
the King’s troops, and not one hundred except in the
towns of Montreal and Quebec are with us. St. John’s
and Montreal must soon fall into their hands, and I doubt
Quebec will follow too soon.’</p>

<p>There was skirmishing between scouts and outposts, and
on the night of the 24th of September, a party of about
150 Americans under Ethan Allen crossed over into the
island of Montreal and penetrated to the suburbs of the
town. Their daring attempt, however, miscarried: they
were driven out: Allen was taken prisoner and sent in
irons to England: and his failure gave for the moment
some encouragement to the Loyalists’ cause.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Carleton
applies to
Gage for
reinforcements.</div>

<p>On hearing of Schuyler’s and Montgomery’s advance
Carleton at once hurried back from Quebec to Montreal.
There were two possibilities of saving the town, and with
it, perhaps, the whole of Canada. One was by obtaining
reinforcements from the British army at Boston, the other
by contriving, even without reinforcements, to hold the
forts at St. John’s and Chambly until winter drove the
invaders back whence they had come. Early in September
Carleton applied to Boston for two regiments, the same
number that in the previous autumn he had sent to Boston
at Gage’s request; his message came to hand on the 10th
of October, just as Gage was leaving for England, and
Howe, who took over the command of the troops, at once
prepared to send the men. But there was a blight on
English sailors as on English soldiers in America in these
days. Admiral Graves, who commanded the ships, refused <span class="sidenote">Admiral Graves refuses to move.</span>
to risk the dangers of the passage from Boston to
Quebec at the season of the year, and Carleton in his sore
straits was left unaided. All, therefore, turned on the
defence of the forts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The siege
of St.
John’s
and
Chambly.</div>

<p>St. John’s fort was manned by between 600 and 700
men, 120 of whom were Canadian volunteers, the rest being
regulars. Chambly was held by some 80 men of the
line. A few men were stationed at Montreal, but Quebec
was almost emptied of its garrison. Major Preston,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> of the
26th Regiment, commanded at St. John’s, and Chambly
was in charge of Major Stopford. On the 18th of September
Montgomery laid siege to the former fort, cutting off communication
between the defenders and the outside world;
but, notwithstanding, news reached Preston of Allen’s
unsuccessful attempt on Montreal, and he held out bravely,
helped by the fact that Montgomery had hardly any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
artillery, and could only rely on starving out the garrison,
while his own men were suffering from exposure, privations,
and want of ammunition. But in the middle of October
the outlook was changed, for, after less than two days’ siege,
the fort at Chambly, said to have been well provisioned, <span class="sidenote">The two forts taken.</span>
and with ample means of defence, was on the 17th of that
month surrendered,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> providing Montgomery with supplies,
guns, and ammunition to be used against the main fort.
Preston’s condition was now desperate. An attempt
made by Carleton to cross from Montreal to his relief on
the 30th of October was beaten back, and on the 2nd of
November, St. John’s surrendered, after having held out
for forty-five days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carleton
leaves
Montreal,</div>

<p>The fall of St. John’s made the defence of Montreal
impossible. Carleton dismissed such of the militia as
were in arms to their homes, and with the few Imperial
troops in the town, rather over 100 in number, and
any arms and supplies that he could carry away, embarked
on the afternoon of the 11th of November to
make the best of his way to Quebec. On the 13th, Montgomery <span class="sidenote">which is occupied by the Americans.</span>
and his men entered Montreal. Already advanced
parties of the Americans were heading down the river
banks. Colonel Maclean, who had come up from Quebec
as far as the Richelieu river with a small body of Canadians
and Scotchmen, to co-operate with Carleton for the
relief of St. John’s, had fallen back, Benedict Arnold was
threatening Quebec itself, and it became a question whether
Carleton would ever reach the city to take charge of its
defence. His vessels and boats sailed down the river to
a point some miles above Sorel at the confluence of the
Richelieu river. There one of them grounded; the wind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
veered round and blew up-stream; for three days the <span class="sidenote">Carleton narrowly escapes capture and reaches Quebec.</span>
little flotilla remained stationary; the enemy overtook
them on the land, raised batteries in front to bar their
progress, and summoned them to surrender. On the
night of the 16th Carleton went on board a whale boat;
silently, with muffled oars, and at one point propelled only
by the rowers’ hands, she dropped down-stream, undetected
by the watchers on the banks. On the 17th Carleton
reached Three Rivers, with the American troops close
behind him, and lower down he met an armed British ship,
which carried him in safety to Quebec. He entered the
city on the 19th. On the same day the vessels in which
he had started from Montreal surrendered with all on board,
and, being brought back to Montreal, were used to carry
Montgomery and his men down to Quebec.</p>

<p>Quebec was already threatened by a small force under
Benedict Arnold. In the year 1761, while General Murray
was in military command of the city and district, an
engineer officer, acting under his instructions, had marked <span class="sidenote">Arnold’s march from the mouth of the Kennebec to Quebec.</span>
out a trail along the route from the Atlantic coast, at the
mouth of the Kennebec river, to the confluence of the
Chaudière with the St. Lawrence over against Quebec.
In 1775, when the American colonists determined to invade
Canada, Washington decided to send an expedition by
this route to co-operate with the main advance by Lake
Champlain and the St. Lawrence. The enterprise required
a daring, resourceful leader, and the command was given
to Arnold. In the middle of September, Arnold embarked
with 1,100 men at Newbury port at the mouth of the
Merrimac, and sailed for the Kennebec. In the latter
days of September he began his march: some 200 batteaux
were taken up the Kennebec, carrying arms, ammunition,
and supplies; the troops were partly on board the boats,
partly kept pace with them on the banks. The expedition
followed the course of the Kennebec and its tributary, the
Dead River, crossed the height of land, reached the headwaters
of the Chaudière in Lake Megantic, and descended
the Chaudière to the St. Lawrence. It was a march of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
much danger and privation, no easy task for a skilled backwoodsman
to accomplish, and full of difficulty when it
was a case of transporting a small army. All through
October and into November the men toiled in the wilderness,
boats were lost, provisions were scarce, the sick and
ailing were left behind, the rearguard turned back, but
eventually Arnold brought two-thirds of his men through,
and, with the goodwill and assistance of the Canadians
on the southern bank of the St. Lawrence, emerged at
Point Levis on the 8th of November, having achieved a
memorable exploit in the military history of America.
On the 14th he crossed the river by night, landed where
Wolfe had landed before his last memorable fight, and,
after summoning the city to surrender without effect,
retreated to Pointe aux Trembles, nearly twenty miles up
the river, to await Montgomery’s arrival. Meanwhile,
Carleton passed by and entered Quebec.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Montgomery
arrives
before
Quebec.</div>

<p>On the 5th of December, Montgomery came upon the
scene, having landed his guns at Cap Rouge, about nine
miles above the city.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> A threatening letter which he sent
to Carleton on the day after his arrival summoning the
British general to surrender, received no answer, and he
took up his position and planted batteries within reach
of the walls on the western side—the side of Wolfe’s attack,
while Arnold occupied the suburb of St. Roch, on the
north of the city, with the river St. Charles behind him.
So far the American advance had been little more than a
procession. Montreal had received Montgomery without
fighting. Three Rivers had given in its adhesion to the
revolutionary cause, without requiring the general’s
presence, as he passed down the river. Nearly all the
British regulars were prisoners; and, with the help of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
disloyal element in the population, Montgomery had good
reason to expect that Quebec would forthwith pass into
his hands and the Imperial Government be deprived of its
last foothold in Canada. He was soon undeceived, however,
and found the task beyond his strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
siege of
Quebec.</div>

<p class="pbot1">His whole force, when united to Arnold’s and including
some Canadians, seems not to have exceeded 2,000 men;
his artillery was inadequate, and winter was coming on.
On the other hand, Carleton’s garrison was a nondescript <span class="sidenote">Number of the garrison.</span>
force of some 1,600 to 1,800 men. Nearly one-third of the
number were Canadians. About 400 were seamen and
marines from the ships in the harbour, including the <i>Lizard</i>
ship of war, which, with one convoy ship containing
stores and arms, represented all the aid that had come
from England. There were less than 300 regulars, including
about 200 of a newly-raised corps under Colonel Maclean’s
command, Scotch veterans who were known as the
Royal Highland Emigrants; and there were about 300
militia of British birth. But the city was well provisioned;
the disloyal citizens had been ejected; Carleton himself had
been through the famous winter siege of 1759-60; and the
preparations which had been made during his recent
absence at Montreal, showed that he had capable officers
serving under him. The upper classes of Canada had
from the first sided with the British Government, and
now that Quebec, the hearth and home of Canada, was in
deadly peril, some spirit of Canadian citizenship was
stirred in its defence.</p>

<p class="p1">Montgomery’s army was too small in numbers, without
the support of powerful artillery which he did not possess,
to justify a direct assault upon the town walls, and a prolonged
siege in the depth of winter meant severe strain on
the American resources with no sure hope of ultimate
success. Moreover, many of the men had enlisted only
for a specified term, which expired at the end of the year.
Before the year closed, therefore, the general determined
to attempt a night surprise, and laid his plans not to
attack the city from the plateau, but to storm the barricades<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
which guarded the lower town by the water’s edge,
and thence to rush the heights above.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The

From Montgomery’s batteries on the Heights of Abraham
the guns opened fire on the town. At Arnold’s camp at
St. Roch, troops placed themselves in evidence under
arms; and, while this semblance of attack was made, the
two leaders led two separate columns from opposite
directions, intended to converge in the centre of the lower
town, so that the combined parties might force the steep
ascent from the port to the city on the cliff.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Repulse
of Montgomery
and his
death.</div>

<p>About two in the morning Montgomery led his men,
according to one account, 900 in number, down to the
river side at Wolfe’s landing-place; and signalling with
rockets to Arnold to begin his march, started about four
o’clock along a rough pathway which skirted the river
under Cape Diamond and led to the lower town. Unnoticed,
it would seem, by an outpost on Cape Diamond,
and by an advance picket, he came at the head of his force
within thirty yards of a barricade, which had been constructed
where the houses began at Prés de Ville. Up to
this point the defenders had given no sign, but now every
gun, large and small, blazed forth: the general fell dead
with 12 of his following, and the whole column beat
a hasty retreat.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Repulse
of
Arnold’s
column.</div>

<p>Meanwhile, on the other side, in the angle between the
St. Charles and the St. Lawrence, Arnold led forward 700
men, passing below Palace Gate, and fired at from the
walls where the garrison were all on the alert, for Carleton
had for some days past been warned of a coming attack.
The Americans crossed a small projecting point, known as
the Sault au Matelot, and reached one end of the narrow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
street which bore the same name. Here there was a
barricade, a second barricade having been erected at the
other end of the street. The first barrier was forced, but
not until Arnold himself had been disabled by a wound;
and led by the Virginian, Daniel Morgan, who was second
in command, and who, later in the war, won the fight at
Cowpens, the assailants pressed boldly on to take the
second barricade and effect a junction with Montgomery.
But Montgomery was no more; the garrison grew constantly
stronger at the threatened point; the way of
retreat was blocked; and caught in a trap, under fire
from the houses, the attacking party surrendered to the
number of 431, in addition to 30 killed, including those
who fell with Montgomery. The day had hardly broken
when all was over, the result being an unqualified success
for the English, a crushing defeat for the American forces.
Quebec was saved, and with Quebec, as events proved,
the whole of Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Continuance
of the
siege.</div>

<p>The English, according to a letter from Carleton to
General Howe, written on the 12th of January, only lost
7 killed and 11 wounded on this memorable night; but,
notwithstanding, in view of the small numbers of the
garrison, the governor did not follow up his success by
any general attack on the American lines; he contented
himself with bringing in five mortars and a cannon from
Arnold’s position, and settled down with his force to wait
for spring. The Americans, from time to time reinforced
by way of Montreal, continued the blockade, but it was
somewhat ineffective, as firewood and even provisions
were at intervals brought into the town. On the 25th of
March a party of Canadians, who attempted to relieve
Quebec by surprising an American battery at Point Levis,
on the other side of the St. Lawrence, were themselves surprised
and suffered a reverse; on the 4th of April the
battery in question opened on the town with little effect:
on the 3rd of May a fire ship was directed against the <span class="sidenote">Quebec relieved on May 6, 1776.</span>
port and proved abortive. On the 6th of May English
ships once more came up the river with reinforcements,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
and the siege was at an end. The Congress troops retreated
in hot haste, as Levis’s men had fled when Murray was
relieved: artillery, ammunition, stores, were left behind;
and the retreat continued beyond Three Rivers, as far as
Sorel, at the mouth of the Richelieu.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carleton’s
Report.</div>

<p>‘After this town had been closely invested by the rebels
for five months and had defeated all their attempts, the
<i>Surprise</i> frigate, <i>Isis</i> and sloop <i>Martin</i> came into the
Basin the 6th instant.... Thus ended our siege and
blockade, during which the mixed garrison of soldiers,
sailors, British and Canadian militia, with the artificers
from Halifax and Newfoundland, showed great zeal and
patience under very severe duty and uncommon vigilance.’
So wrote Carleton to Lord George Germain on the 14th of
May, 1776, having conducted a singularly successful
defence of an all important point. Murray’s defence of
Quebec had been marked by a severe reverse, great sickness,
privation, and loss. Nothing of the kind happened under
Carleton. He had, it is true, a far smaller army against
him than besieged Murray, and he had the inestimable
advantage of personal experience of the former siege, but
on the other hand the force which he commanded was infinitely
weaker, numerically and in training, than Murray’s.
He made no mistakes, incurred no risks, his one aim was
to save Quebec, and he saved it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Importance
of
holding
Quebec.</div>

<p>The more the history of these times is studied, the greater
importance will be attached to Carleton’s successful defence
of Quebec, and his defeat of the American forces
beneath its walls; the more clearly too it will be seen that
the net result of the American war was due at least as
much to the agency of individual men as to any combination
of moral or material forces. Whoever held Quebec
held Canada; and, if Great Britain had lost Quebec in
the winter of 1775-6, she would in all probability have
lost Canada for all time. Wolfe’s victory before Quebec,
and the surrender of the city which followed, determined
that Canada should become a British possession. Carleton’s
defeat of Montgomery and Arnold in the suburbs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
of Quebec, and the holding of the city which followed, determined
that Canada should remain a British possession.
It was not merely a question of the geographical position
of Quebec, great as was its importance from a strategical
point of view. It was a question of the effect of its
retention or its loss upon the minds of men. The Canadians
were wavering: the tide was flowing against the
English: one rock alone was not submerged: the waves
beat against it and subsided. Thenceforward Canada
was never in serious danger. The Americans were not
liked in Canada. They carried many of the Canadians
with them in the first impulse, but, when once they were
checked and driven back, the Canadians were given time
to think, and they inclined to the cause personified by the
man who had stemmed the tide of invasion and held
Quebec.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carleton
as a
general,</div>

<p>When the news of what had taken place reached England
at the beginning of June, Horace Walpole wrote to
his friend Sir Horace Mann. ‘The provincials have again
attempted to storm Quebec and been repulsed with great
loss by the conduct and bravery of Carleton, who, Mr.
Conway has all along said, would prove himself a very
able general.’<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Two months later he wrote again to the
same friend: ‘You have seen by the public newspapers
that General Carleton has driven the provincials out of all
Canada. It is well he fights better than he writes.
General Conway has constantly said that he would do
great service.’<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> Of Carleton’s merits as a soldier there
can be no question. No one ever gauged a military situation
better. No one ever displayed more firmness and
courage at a time of crisis, made more of small resources,
or showed more self-restraint. But he was more than a
good military leader; he was also a statesman of high <span class="sidenote">and as a statesman.</span>
order, and, had he been given a free hand and supreme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
control of the British forces and policy in America, he
might well have kept the American colonies as he kept
Quebec. For Carleton was an understanding man. No <span class="sidenote">Carleton’s character.</span>
Englishman in America, or who dealt with America, was
of the same calibre. He knew the land: he knew the
people: he had the qualities which were conspicuously
wanting in other English leaders of the time, firmness, foresight,
breadth of view, sound judgement as to what was
possible and what was not; above all, he had a character
above and beyond intrigue. Had he not been ousted by
malign influence, but been given wider powers and a more
extensive command, the British cause in North America
might have had the one thing needful, a personality to
stand in not unworthy comparison with that of Washington.</p>

<p>Carleton was a little over fifty years old at the time of the
siege of Quebec. The two American generals who confronted
him were younger men. Montgomery was just
under forty years of age when he was killed; Arnold at
the time was not thirty-five. It would have been well for
Arnold’s reputation had he shared Montgomery’s fate.
A New Englander by birth, a native of Connecticut, he <span class="sidenote">Benedict Arnold.</span>
seems to have been a restless, adventurous man, with no
strong sense of principle. His name is clouded by his
grievous treachery at West Point, but his military capacity
was as great as his personal courage, and of all the American
leaders in the earlier stages of the war, he was the man
who dealt the hardest blows at the British cause in Canada.
From the capture of the forts on Lake Champlain till the
fights before Burgoyne’s surrender at Saratoga, at almost
every point on the frontier he was in evidence, leading
attack, covering retreat, invaluable as a leader in
border war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Richard
Montgomery.</div>

<p>Of Montgomery, Horace Walpole wrote that he ‘was
not so fortunate as Wolfe to die a conqueror, though very
near being so’.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> He was so far fortunate in his death,
that his name has passed into American history as that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
of a martyr to the cause of liberty. He was known to
Burke, Fox, and the leaders of the Opposition in England;
and he seems to have been an attractive man in private
life as well as a capable soldier. We read in the <i>Annual
Register</i> for 1776 that ‘The excellency of his qualities and
disposition had procured him an uncommon share of
private affection, as his abilities had of public esteem;
and there was probably no man engaged on the same side,
and few on either, whose loss would have been so much
regretted both in England and America’.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> In America
addresses and monuments commemorated his name,
Tryon county of New York was renamed Montgomery
county in honour to his memory, and in 1818 his remains
were exhumed and taken to New York for public burial.
In England leading politicians bore tribute to his merits,
and as late as the year 1791, in the House of Commons,
Fox called to Burke’s remembrance how the two friends
had ‘sympathized almost in tears for the fall of a Montgomery.’<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
He died fighting for what proved to be the
winning cause, and men spoke well of him. But there is
another side to the picture which should not be overlooked.
Montgomery was not, like Arnold, born and bred on New
England soil. He was ‘a gentleman of good family in the
kingdom of Ireland’,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> and educated at Trinity College,
Dublin. He had worn the King’s uniform from 1756 to
1772; he had served as a subaltern at the capture of
Louisbourg, under Amherst again on Lake Champlain, and
with Haviland’s division in the final British advance on
Montreal, by the line by which in 1775 he led the American
troops into Canada. After the British conquest of Canada
he had seen active service in the West Indies. His connexion
with the North American colonies consisted in
having bought an estate in New York, having married
a lady of the well-known Livingston family in that state,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
and having made his home there after retirement from
the army. That retirement took place in 1772. In 1775
he was a brigadier-general in the American army, not
concerned to defend house and home against unprovoked
attack, but to lead an army of invasion into a neighbouring
British province, endeavouring to wrest from Great Britain
what he himself had fought to give her, and identifying
oppression with one whose worth he must well have
known, with a fellow British soldier of Carleton’s high
character and name. Montgomery was an Irishman. In
his case, as in that of Arnold, the wife’s influence probably
counted for much; and the time was one when what were
called generous instincts were at a premium and principles
were at a discount. But the terms<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> in which he summoned
Carleton to surrender suggest unfavourable contrast
between his own words and actions on the one hand,
and on the other the stern old-fashioned views of loyalty
and military honour which Carleton held, and which forbade
him to pay to Montgomery in his lifetime the respect
which was ensured by a soldier’s death.</p>

<p>Montgomery had charged Carleton with inhumanity.
Carleton was a soldier who did not play with war and
rebellion, but he was also a humane man, and the charge,
if it needed any contradiction, is belied by a proclamation
which he issued on the 10th of May, four days after the
relief of Quebec. In it search was directed to be made for
sick and wounded Americans, reported to be ‘dispersed
in the adjacent woods and parishes, and in great danger
of perishing for want of proper assistance’. They were
to be given relief and brought in to the General Hospital
at Quebec, a promise being added that, as soon as their
health was restored, they should be at liberty to return
to their homes.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span><a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p>

<p>Quebec was relieved on the 6th of May. Some ships
were sent up the river, but Carleton waited for the reinforcements
which were fast coming in from England before
making a decided move, and it was not until the beginning
of June that Three Rivers was re-occupied by the Royal
troops. Meanwhile, the American head quarters at Montreal
had been alarmed by a diversion from another
quarter. The invading forces had broken into Canada at <span class="sidenote">The affair of the Cedars.</span>
two points only. Montgomery’s advance had been direct
to Montreal: Arnold had marched straight on Quebec.
The British outposts above Montreal and in the west had
been left undisturbed. One of them, very small in
numbers, was stationed at Ogdensburg, then known as
Oswegatchie, a few years previously the scene of the Abbé
Piquet’s mission of La Présentation. The commander
was Captain Forster of the 8th Regiment of the line, the
same regiment which in the later war of 1812 played so
conspicuous a part in the defence of Canada. Towards
the end of the second week in May, Forster, with about
50 regulars and volunteers and some 200 Indians,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a>
started down the St. Lawrence, his objective being the
Cedars, a place on the northern bank of the St. Lawrence
below Lake St. Francis in that river, and a few miles above<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Lake St. Louis and the island of Montreal. Here an
American force was stationed, numbering nearly 400 men.
On the 18th and 19th of May Forster attacked the post,
which surrendered on the second day; and on the 20th
another small party of Americans, rather under 100 in
number, which was advancing from Vaudreuil, seven miles
to the north of the Cedars, surrendered to a mixed body
of Canadians and Indians. By these two successes
Forster secured between 400 and 500 prisoners, and
crossing over to the island of Montreal, he advanced against
Lachine, where a considerable force of Americans was
encamped. These men were under the command of
Arnold who, on recovering from the wound which he
had received at Quebec, had been placed in charge of the
Congress troops at Montreal. Forster found the position
and the numbers defending it too strong to attack, although
he had been reinforced by a large party of Canadians.
Accordingly, he retired to the mainland. Arnold then
attempted to cross and make a counter attack, but was in
turn obliged to recross to the island. There then followed
negotiations for the release of the prisoners, who were
handed over to Arnold on condition that British prisoners
should be subsequently released in exchange, and at the
end of the month Forster returned to Oswegatchie.</p>

<p>His exploit had been a notable one. With a very insignificant
following he had defeated superior numbers and
had threatened Montreal. History repeated itself; and,
as in the days of New France, the Canadians and Indians
showed themselves formidable in sudden raids, supplementing
the regular plan of campaign. The affair of the
Cedars proved that, as long as Quebec and the mouth of
the St. Lawrence were in British keeping, the American
army of occupation would be troubled on the western side
by home-bred combatants, stiffened by British outposts
which could only be dislodged as the result of a general
conquest of Canada. Canada was in fact far from conquered,
and in a very short time the country was cleared
of its foes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>But Forster’s enterprise obtained notoriety for another
and a different reason. The Congress of the revolting <span class="sidenote">Dispute with Congress as to the exchange of prisoners.</span>
states refused to ratify the agreement to which Arnold
had consented. The American prisoners, with the exception
of a few hostages, were sent back, but the promised
exchanges were not made, and the reason given for not
fulfilling the engagement was that some of Forster’s
prisoners had been murdered and others maltreated and
plundered. Congress therefore resolved not to give back
the requisite number of British prisoners, until the authors
and abettors of the alleged crimes had been handed over
and compensation made for the plunder. The allegations
seem in the main not to have been substantiated, as is
shown by a letter from one of the American hostages themselves.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
That the Indians looted some of the prisoners’
property was undeniable, but Forster appears to have used
every effort to secure the safety and good treatment of
those who were in his hands, and the charges of murder
were not made good. Carleton wrote strongly on the
subject,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> attributing the action of the American Congress
to a desire to embitter their people against the English
and to prolong the war; but at this distance of time it is
unnecessary to revive the controversy. What is worth
noting is the feeling aroused when coloured men are enlisted,
or even alleged to be enlisted, on either side in white men’s
quarrels, the exaggerated reports which are spread abroad,
and the credence which is given to them. The record of
Indian warfare in North America was a terrible one, and
it is no matter for surprise if, when Indians were found
fighting on the British side, the barbarities of the past
were reported to have been reproduced at a later
date.</p>

<div class="sidenote">American
delegates
sent to
Montreal.</div>

<p>Before Quebec had been relieved, the weakness of the
American hold on Canada, and the condition of the army
of occupation, had given anxiety to Congress, who sent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
special commissioners to Montreal. The commissioners
were three in number. One was Benjamin Franklin, and
another was Carroll, a Roman Catholic, who was accompanied
by his brother, a Jesuit priest. The object was to
ascertain the actual position of matters military and
political, and to conciliate Canadian feeling. What was
ascertained was depressing enough, and the efforts at
conciliation came to nothing. While the commissioners
were at Montreal, they received news of the relief of
Quebec, and events soon swept away recommendations.
The American army fell back from Quebec to the Richelieu; <span class="sidenote">Retreat of the American army.</span>
and, as the troops came in from England, including
some German regiments under Baron Riedesel, Carleton
sent them up the St. Lawrence by land and water, Burgoyne
being in command. In the first days of June Three
Rivers was garrisoned; and within a week, on the 8th of
June, an American general, Thompson, who made an
attempt to regain the position, crossing over by night from
the southern shore, was cut off and taken prisoner with
over 200 of his men. This completed the discomfiture of
the Americans: small-pox and other diseases were rife in <span class="sidenote">Montreal re-occupied by the English, and preparations made for an advance up Lake Champlain.</span>
their ranks: their posts on the line of the Richelieu were
hastily abandoned; Arnold barely had time to evacuate
Montreal; and, before the last week of June began, Montreal,
Chambly, and St. John’s were all again in British
possession, and the invasion of Canada was at an end.</p>

<p>The Americans, however, still retained their hold on
Lake Champlain. It was impossible to dislodge them
without organizing transport by water as well as by land,
and building armed vessels to overpower the ships with
which they commanded the lake. For when they overran
Canada as far as Quebec, they secured all the sailing craft
and bateaux on the Upper St. Lawrence. ‘The task
was indeed arduous,’ says a contemporary writer, ‘a fleet
of above thirty fighting vessels, of different kinds and
sizes, all furnished with cannon, was to be little less than
recreated.’<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Three months, therefore, were taken up in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
boat-building, the material being in large measure sent out
from England, in making roads, constructing entrenchments,
drilling the troops, and collecting supplies. The
troops, over 10,000 in number, were stationed at La
Prairie on the St. Lawrence, immediately opposite Montreal,
at Chambly, St. John’s, and the Isle aux Noix, with
detachments lower down the Richelieu river than Chambly
in order to keep all the communications open; and in
September, when the preparations were nearly completed,
advanced parties were moved forward to the opening of
Lake Champlain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fighting
on Lake
Champlain.</div>

<p>In October the newly-constructed gunboats ascended
the Richelieu river from St. John’s, and entered the lake.
On the 11th they came into touch with the American
vessels, which were then stationed, under Arnold’s command,
between Valcour Island and the western shore of
the lake. The place was about five miles south of Plattsburg,
about twenty-five miles south of what is now the
boundary line of Canada, and a little less than fifty
miles to the north of Crown Point. The strait between
the island and the mainland is about a mile wide, and
across it was the American line of battle. The English
had the superiority in numbers and, as the result of the
first day’s fighting, being carried to the south of the enemy’s
ships, were at the close of the day drawn up in line to
intercept their retreat. At night, however, Arnold, bold
and skilful as ever, found a passage through and sailed off
to the south, hotly pursued by Carleton’s squadron. On
the 13th fighting began again, and ended with the capture <span class="sidenote">Destruction of the American flotilla.</span>
or destruction of twelve American vessels, out of a total of
fifteen, over 100 prisoners being taken including the second
in command to Arnold. Crown Point was set on fire and <span class="sidenote">Crown Point abandoned by the Americans.</span>
abandoned by the Americans, and on the 14th Carleton
wrote from his ship off that place reporting his success.
In his dispatch he expressed doubts whether anything
further could be done at that late season of the year, and
he subsequently came to the conclusion that an attack on
Ticonderoga, which was held by a strong force under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
Gates, must be postponed till the following spring. Nor
did he think it prudent to occupy Crown Point, which
was in a dismantled and ruined condition, through the <span class="sidenote">Close of the campaign.</span>
winter, and by the middle of November, he had withdrawn
all his forces to the Isle aux Noix and St. John’s, whence
he had started.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carleton
censured
by Germain.</div>

<p>It was a good summer’s work. Quebec had been relieved,
the whole of Canada had been recovered, and on
the main line of invasion, Lake Champlain, the English
had obtained the upper hand by the destruction of Arnold’s
vessels. This last part of the campaign stands out in
bright contrast to the abortive Plattsburg expedition in
the later war of 1812. If there had been any delay, it
was largely due to the fact that Carleton had not received
from England all the boats and materials for boat-building
for which he had requisitioned; and, to judge from Horace
Walpole, intelligent observers in England were not disappointed
with the outcome of the autumn fighting. ‘You
will see the particulars of the naval victory in the <i>Gazette</i>,’
he wrote to Sir Horace Mann on the 26th of November,
1776, ‘It is not much valued here, as it is thought Carleton
must return to Quebec for the winter.’ Nevertheless, the
British Government, as represented by Lord George
Germain, professed to be dissatisfied that more had not
been achieved, and that, having reached Crown Point,
the general had not made a further advance against
Ticonderoga, or at least held his ground where he was
through the winter. Germain, who in January, 1776, had
succeeded Dartmouth in charge of colonial matters, had
begun by finding fault with Carleton, complaining that
the latter had left the Home Government in the dark as to
his plan of operations after the relief of Quebec, and as
to the position in Canada. The result was, Germain
wrote, that it was impossible at the time to send Carleton
any further instructions.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> It would have been well if the
impossibility had continued. He found new ground for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
criticism in Carleton’s temporary retreat from Lake
Champlain, but the criticism was wholly without justification.
Carleton was a cautious leader; he had shown
caution in the defence of Quebec, where events had justified
his attitude; but the whole record of the 1776 campaign
had proved him to be at the same time a man of
energy, firmness, and resource, unwearied in organizing,
prompt in action. Wolfe, it might be said, would at all
hazards have attacked Ticonderoga, but it must be
remembered that Wolfe in America, where he always
preached and practised forward aggressive movement,
was fighting Frenchmen and Indians, not soldiers of the
same race as his own. If we compare Amherst, on the
other hand, with Carleton, we find that Amherst in 1759,
having taken Ticonderoga and Crown Point by the
beginning of August, made no further move till the middle
of October, and then, after an abortive start down Lake
Champlain, gave up active operations for the winter.
There is no valid reason to suppose that Carleton’s judgement
was otherwise than sound. At any rate, to quote
his own words to Germain in a letter written on the 20th
of May, 1777, ‘Any officer entrusted with the supreme
command ought, upon the spot, to see what was most
expedient to be done, better than a great general at 3,000
miles distance.’<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The
English
generals
in
America.</div>

<p>Less capable than Carleton were the other British officers
in America, and far less satisfactory were the results of
their efforts. In the early days of 1775, before fighting
actually began, Amherst, the former Commander-in-Chief
in North America, was invited by the King to resume his
command, but declined the invitation, and General Gage
was accordingly retained in that position. To support
him, three generals were sent out from England, Howe,
Burgoyne, and Clinton. They arrived towards the end
of May, 1775, after the fight at Lexington had taken
place, and before the battle of Bunker’s Hill. Early in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
1776 Lord Cornwallis also appeared upon the scene.
After the battle of Bunker’s Hill, Gage was recalled to
England, and Howe was placed in command of the troops
on the Atlantic seaboard, while Carleton was given independent
command in Canada. Gage left in October,
1775, and Howe, his successor, remained in America
till May, 1778, having sent in his resignation a few
months previously. Clinton succeeded Howe, and held
the command until the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown
in October, 1781, turned out the ministry and
practically finished the war. Then, when it was too late,
Carleton was named as commander-in-chief, and arrived
at New York in May, 1782, by which time the fighting
was practically over.</p>

<p>These men, who commanded the armies of England in
America during a disastrous war, were by no means
hopelessly incompetent. Howe had been one of the best <span class="sidenote">Howe.</span>
of Wolfe’s officers. He had led the advanced party
which stormed the Heights of Abraham on the memorable
morning of the 13th of September, 1759. In the revolutionary
war, though found wanting in some of the
qualities which make a great general, he none the less
showed firmness, courage, and skill in various actions
from Bunker’s Hill onwards, and he achieved several
notable successes. Clinton proved himself to be at least <span class="sidenote">Clinton.</span>
an average commander. Burgoyne, in a subordinate
position, was apparently a good soldier; and the subsequent <span class="sidenote">Burgoyne.</span>
career of Lord Cornwallis showed that he was a
man of capacity. Comparing them with the predecessors
of Wolfe and Amherst in the late French war, with <span class="sidenote">Cornwallis.</span>
Loudoun, Webb, and Abercromby, and bearing in mind
that they had a far more difficult task, they stand in no
unfavourable light. But they were not leaders of men
themselves, and there was no man in power in England,
such as Chatham had been, who was a leader of men, strong
enough to break down political intrigue and court influence,
to find the best men and send them out, superseding the
second best, encouraging and supporting his soldiers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
sailors, but not worrying them with ill-timed and ignorant
interference.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
English
admirals.</div>

<p>On the sea England was even less fortunate in the men
who served her than on land, whereas, as events proved,
the possibility of success in the war depended entirely on
keeping command of the sea. In the time of the Seven
Years’ War, the English admirals were at their best.
Hawke, in his brilliant fight at Quiberon, did hardly better
service than the less known Admiral Saunders, who co-operated
heart and soul with Wolfe at Quebec. Widely
different was the naval record of the War of American
Independence. The French navy, it is true, was stronger
than in former years, but the naval commanders on the
English side were also less adequate. The competent men
were superseded by, or had to serve under, senior and less
competent officers. Sir George Collier, who showed
energy and ability, was succeeded by an inferior man,
Marriot Arbuthnot; and, at the most critical point of the
campaign, when the French admiral, de Grasse, combined
with Washington to procure the surrender of Cornwallis,
Sir Samuel Hood, one of the best, had to take his orders
from Admiral Graves, one of the least competent of
British naval officers. Even Rodney, who had not yet
won the great victory in the West Indies, by which he is
best remembered, seems to have been remiss in regard to
North America; and, if Hood be excepted, Lord Howe
alone among the famous seamen of England, during a short
period of the war, showed something of the skill and
energy which, at other times, and in other than American
waters, characterized the leaders of the British navy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Military
science
was not
conspicuous
in the
American
War of
Independence.</div>

<p>Apart altogether from its causes and its results, and
dealing only with the actual operations, the War of
American Independence was a most unsatisfactory, and
for the English, a most inglorious war. It might well
have resulted in a far more crushing defeat for England,
and yet have left a much better impression on English
minds. Though the war lasted for fully seven years, on
neither side, with one exception, were very great military<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
reputations made. The American Civil War of later days
was marked by notable military achievements, and extraordinarily
stubborn fighting. It was a terrible but a
heart-whole struggle, fought hard to the bitter end under
men, among winners and losers alike, whose names will live
to all time in military history. In the American War of
Independence, on the other hand, though good soldiers
were engaged on either side and some, such as the American
general, Nathaniel Greene, deservedly attained high
reputation, yet the only name which lives for the world at
large because of the war itself, is that of Washington; and
it lives not so much because of brilliant feats of generalship,
as because he led a murmuring people through the wilderness
with statesmanship, rare nobility of character, and
unconquerable patience. ‘Few of the great pages of
history,’ writes Mr. Lecky, ‘are less marked by the
stamp of heroism than the American Revolution.’<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> The
Americans muddled through, because the English made
more mistakes, and because, though the American people
were divided among themselves, their leaders, at any rate,
knew their own minds, and were not half-hearted like the
majority of leading men at the time in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>For neither the English nation nor the English Government
were wholehearted in the war. It was of the nature
of a civil war, with little to appeal to on the English side.
It is true that it was for a time popular in England, that the
intervention of France prolonged its popularity, and that
the outrageous extravagances of Fox and other extreme
Whigs also tended to provoke honest patriotism in favour
of the Government and their policy; but it was not truly a
nation’s war, guided by the nation’s chosen leaders. Not
only was there strong opposition to it in England, for reasons
which have already been given, strong especially in the
personality of men like Chatham and Burke who opposed it,
but the ministry themselves showed that their heart was <span class="sidenote">Wavering attitude of the English Government</span>
not in their work. Twice in the middle of the struggle they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
tried to make peace. In 1776, the brothers Howe at New
York, Whigs themselves, were commissioned to open
negotiations with the colonists: but their powers in
granting concessions were far too limited to satisfy
opponents, who had already, on the 4th of July in that
year, declared for independence. Again in 1778, under an
Act of Parliament, specially passed for the purpose, commissioners
were appointed to negotiate for peace. They
were five in number, two being, as before, the brothers
Howe,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> and the other three being delegates specially sent
out from home. This time ample powers were given to
make concessions, but the situation was wholly changed.
Burgoyne had surrendered in the preceding autumn, the
French had joined hands with the colonists, and Philadelphia
was being evacuated by the British troops. Had
the commissioners been sent out after some striking
success on the side of England, offering generous terms
from a strong and resolute nation, they might have gained
a hearing, and the proffered concessions might have been
accepted. Under the circumstances the mission was
interpreted as a sign of weakness, and the messages which
were brought were treated with contempt.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and of the
generals.</div>

<p>As it was with the Government, so it was also with
the military men. Amherst would not serve because of
his old friendly relations with the Americans. General
Howe, for similar reasons, was at first loth to serve, and
his delays and shortcomings in prosecuting the war may
perhaps be in part attributed to the same cause. Howe,
Burgoyne, and Clinton all came out in 1775 from the
House of Commons, politicians as well as soldiers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span><a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
Burgoyne was brought home towards the end of 1775. He
went out again to Canada in the spring of 1776, again went
home in the autumn of that year, and again went out in
1777 for his last disastrous campaign. Cornwallis went
to England twice in the course of the war. It was probably
a mere coincidence, but the fact remains that the
two commanders who suffered the greatest disasters, were
the two who went back and fore between England and
America, and presumably came most under the influence
of the mischievous ministry at home. It is true that
Wolfe had gone home in 1758 after the taking of Louisburg,
discontented with the tardiness of Amherst’s movements,
and that he went out again in 1759 to his crowning victory
and death; but Wolfe went home to Chatham, Burgoyne
and Cornwallis to Lord George Germain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Want of
continuity
in the
military
operations
on the
English
side.</div>

<p>Take again the spasmodic operations of the war.
Boston, held when war broke out, and for the retention
of which Bunker’s Hill was fought, was subsequently
abandoned. Philadelphia was occupied and again evacuated.
The southern colonies were over-run but not held.
At point after point the Loyalists were first encouraged
and then left to their fate. Everything was attempted
in turn but nothing done, or what was done was again
undone. The vacillation and infirmity of purpose, which
has so often marred the public action of England, was
never more manifest than in the actual campaigns of the
War of American Independence. The great difficulty to
contend with was the large area covered by the revolting
colonies; and the one hope of subduing them lay in
blockading the coasts and concentrating instead of dispersing
the British land forces. Lord Howe and Lord
Amherst are credited with the view that the only chance
of success for England lay in a purely naval war; and
it is said to have been on Amherst’s advice that Philadelphia
was abandoned and the troops concentrated at
New York. The true policy was, as Captain Mahan has
pointed out,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> and as Carleton had seen before the war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
came,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> to cut the colonies in two by holding the line of
the Hudson and Lake Champlain; and the object of
sending Burgoyne down from Canada by way of Lake
Champlain in 1777 was that he might join hands with the
British forces on the Atlantic coast, as they moved up the
Hudson from New York. But, while Burgoyne was
marching south, Howe carried off the bulk of the troops
from New York to attack Philadelphia; and there followed,
as a direct consequence, the ruin of Burgoyne’s
force and its surrender at Saratoga. No positive instructions
had reached Howe as to co-operating with Burgoyne,
and the well-known story goes<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> that this oversight was
due to Lord George Germain, who had fathered the enterprise,
going out of town at the moment when the dispatches
should have been signed and sent. At any rate, it is
clear that, even when the British Government had formed
a right conception of the course to be followed, they failed
to take ordinary precautions for ensuring that it was
carried into effect. In Canada alone did the English rise
to the occasion. Here, and here only, was a man among
them in the early stages of the war who moved on a higher
plane altogether than his contemporaries in action, a statesman-general
of dignity, foresight and prudence. Here
alone too the English were repelling invasion, and keeping
for the nation what the nation had won. In this wrong-headed
struggle the one and only ray of brightness for
England shone out from Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Operations
on the
Atlantic
seaboard.</div>

<p>After the battle of Bunker’s Hill, in June, 1775, the
British army of occupation at Boston spent the year in
a state of siege. Gage was recalled to England in October,
the command of the troops being handed over to Howe.
Burgoyne too went home, returning to Canada in the
following spring. The autumn and the winter went by,
Carleton being beleaguered in Quebec, and Howe cooped
up in Boston, while British ships bombarded one or two of
the small seaport towns on the American coast, causing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
misery and exasperation, without effecting any useful
result. Early in 1776, Clinton and Cornwallis were sent
to carry war into the southern states, and towards the
end of June made an unsuccessful attack on Charleston
Harbour.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Howe
evacuates
Boston
and occupies
New
York.</div>

<p>In March Howe evacuated Boston, and brought off his
troops to Halifax. In June he set sail for New York, which
was held by Washington; established himself on Staten
Island, where he was joined by his brother, the admiral,
with strong reinforcements; and, having now ample troops
under his command, he took action in the middle of August.
Crossing over to Long Island, he inflicted a heavy blow on
Washington’s army on the 27th of August, but did not
follow up his success, with the result that Washington two
days later carried over his troops to New York. In the
middle of September New York was evacuated by the
Americans and occupied by the English, and through
October and November, Washington was driven back
with loss, until by the beginning of the second week in
December, he had retreated over the Delaware to Philadelphia,
and the whole of the country between that river
and the Hudson, which forms the State of New Jersey, was
in British hands. The American cause was further
depressed by the temporary loss of General Charles Lee,
who had been surprised and taken prisoner. He was one
of the few American leaders who was a practised soldier,
having been before the war a half-pay officer of the British
army; at the time of his capture he stood second only to
Washington.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Howe’s
delays.</div>

<p>Howe had been almost uniformly successful, but at each
step he had been slow to follow up his successes. In all
wars in which trained soldiers are pitted against untrained
men, it must be of the utmost importance to give
as little breathing space as possible to the latter, for delay
gives time for learning discipline, regaining confidence,
and realizing that defeat may be repaired. Easy to check
and to keep on the run in the initial stages of such a war,
the untried levies gradually harden into seasoned soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
taking repulses not as irreparable disasters, but as incidents
in a campaign. For those who set out to subdue
a stubborn race it is a fatal mistake to give their enemies
time to learn the trade of war. Especially is it a mistake
when, as in the case of the Americans, the causes of the
war and the ultimate objects are at the outset not yet
clearly defined, when there are misgivings and hesitations
as to the rights and wrongs, the necessities of the case, the
most desirable issue: most of all when one side represents
a loose confederation of jealous states, and not one single-minded
nation. Howe seems to have lost sight of these
considerations, and not to have wished to press matters
too far. While engaged in taking New York, he was also
busy with his brother in trying vainly to negotiate terms
of peace; and subsequently, while mastering New Jersey,
instead of completing his success by sending ships and
troops round to the Delaware to attack Washington in
Philadelphia, he dispatched Clinton to the north to occupy
Newport in Rhode Island, a point of vantage for the
naval warfare, but held at the cost of dispersing instead
of concentrating the British forces.</p>

<p>Yet, as the year 1776 drew towards its close, all seemed
going well for the English in America. Carleton from
Canada, Howe from New York, had uninterrupted progress
to report. With Christmas night there came another
tale. In fancied security after the late campaign, Howe’s <span class="sidenote">Washington’s victory at Trenton.</span>
troops in New Jersey were quartered at different points,
the commander-in-chief remaining at New York, and
Cornwallis, who had commanded in New Jersey, being on
the point of leaving for England. The village of Trenton
on the Delaware, through which passed the road from
New York to Philadelphia, was held by a strong detachment
of Hessians under General Rahl, whose whole force,
including a few British cavalry, numbered about 1,400
men. No entrenchments had been constructed, few precautions
had been taken against attack, and Christmas
time and Christmas weather made for want of vigilance.
Crossing the Delaware with 2,500 men, Washington broke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
in upon the position in the early morning of December 26th,
amid snow and rain, and the surprise was complete:
General Rahl was mortally wounded; between 900 and
1,000 of his men were killed, wounded, or taken prisoners;
and not many more than 400 made good their escape.
Returning with his prisoners to Philadelphia, Washington
again re-crossed the Delaware, and during the rest of the
winter and the first six months of the year 1777 continually
harassed the English in New Jersey, avoiding a general
engagement, which Howe vainly endeavoured to bring on.
At length, towards the end of July, Howe evacuated the <span class="sidenote">Howe retreats from the Jerseys, and occupies Philadelphia.</span>
territory, and, leaving Clinton with over 8,000 men at New
York, shipped the rest of his army for Chesapeake Bay,
resolved to attack the enemy from the opposite direction
and to take Philadelphia. Washington gave him battle
on the Brandywine river early in September and was
defeated. On the 26th of September Howe entered
Philadelphia: and on the 4th of October at Germantown,
five miles distant from the city, he successfully repelled
a sudden attack by which Washington attempted to repeat
the success of Trenton. At Brandywine, Washington
lost some 1,300 men, at Germantown over 1,000; but,
while Germantown was being fought, Burgoyne’s army on
the upper reaches of the Hudson was nearing its final
disaster.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Far-reaching
consequences
of the
fight at
Trenton.</div>

<p>The War of American Independence, to quote the words
of the <i>Annual Register</i> for 1777,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> was ‘a war of posts,
surprises, and skirmishes, instead of a war of battles’.
The disaster to the Hessians at Trenton was what
would have been called in the late South African war
a regrettable incident, but it had far-reaching consequences.
The German troops employed by the British
Government were not unnaturally regarded by the
American colonists with special dislike and apprehension.
They were foreigners and professional soldiers, alien in
sympathies and in speech, partisans in a quarrel with
which they had no concern, fighting for profit not for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
principle. The citizen general, at the darkest time of the
national cause, came back to Philadelphia, bringing a
number of them prisoners, and broke at once the spell of ill
success. There followed, as a direct consequence, the
abandonment of the Jerseys by the English, the rising
again of colonial feeling throughout the region, and
corresponding depression of the Loyalists. But almost
more important was the effect on the side of Canada; for
the Trenton episode led to the supersession of Carleton
and to his eventual resignation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Secretary
of State
for the
American
Department.</div>

<p>In the year 1768 the office of Secretary of State for the
American Department was created in England, to deal
especially with colonial matters. The Council of Trade
and Plantations, which in one form or another had hitherto
taken charge of the colonies, was not superseded, but to
the new Secretary of State it fell to handle questions of
war and peace with the American colonies. The appointment
was not long lived, being abolished, together with
the Council of Trade and Plantations, by Burke’s Act in
1782. The first Secretary of State for the American
Department was Lord Hillsborough; the second, appointed
in 1772, was Lord Dartmouth, in character and sympathy,
a pleasing exception to the type of politicians who at the
time had power in Great Britain; the third, appointed at
the beginning of 1776, was Lord George Germain who,
when he took office, was about sixty years of age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord
George
Germain.</div>

<p>No name in English political history during the last
150 years is less loved than that of Lord George Sackville,
or, as he was known in later years, Lord George Germain.
He was born in 1716, a younger son of the first Duke of
Dorset. Lady Betty Germain, who died in 1769, left him
the Drayton estate<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> in Northamptonshire, and he took<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
her name. Ten years before, he had been cashiered for
disobedience to an order to charge at the battle of Minden
in 1759, laying himself open by his conduct in that battle
to what was no doubt an unfounded charge of cowardice.
He took to political life, and has been commonly regarded
as in a special manner the evil genius of the British
ministry during the war with America. Yet he was not
a man without parts. In his early life he had some
reputation as a soldier, being highly spoken of by Wolfe.
After he was dismissed from the army, he pertinaciously
demanded a court-martial, though warned that more
serious results even than dismissal might follow from
re-opening the case. The inquiry was held, and the
dismissal confirmed; but, helped no doubt by his family
connexions, he held up his head in public life, and became,
in Horace Walpole’s opinion, one of the five best speakers
in the House of Commons.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Walpole, and probably others
also, disbelieved the charge of cowardice;<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> and certainly
in politics, whatever may have been the case on the battlefield,
Germain cannot be denied the merits of courage and
tenacity, though he may well have been embittered by his
past, and hardened into fighting narrowly for his own
hand. He became a follower of Lord North, and under
him was appointed a Lord Commissioner of Trade and
Plantations and Secretary of State for the American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Department. He was an unbending opponent of the
colonists and their claims. ‘I don’t want you to come
and breathe fire and sword against the Bostonians like
that second Duke of Alva, the inflexible Lord George
Germain,’ wrote Horace Walpole in January, 1775,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> before
Germain had taken office. To use Germain’s own words, he
would be satisfied with nothing less from the Americans
than ‘unlimited submission’.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>Germain seems to have been deeply imbued with the
great political vice of the time, that of dealing with national
questions from a personal and partisan point of view. It
was a vice inculcated by George the Third. The King was
a narrow man: his school bred narrow men: and one of
the narrowest was Lord George Germain. Such men are
fearful of power passing from their hands, and are consequently
prone to be constantly interfering with their
officers. Hence it was that the evil of ministers trying
to order the operations of generals, and of men in one
continent purporting to regulate movements in another,
was more pronounced at this time than at almost any
other period in English history. Moreover, Lord George
Germain having been a soldier, though a discredited one,
no doubt thought that he could control armies; and,
mixing military knowledge with political intrigue, he communed
with the generals who came home, and formulated
plans with slight regard to the views of the responsible
men in America. The result was disastrous, in spite of
the fact that he seems to have formed a true conception
of the campaign, viz., that the one army in Canada and
the other at New York should co-operate and cut in
two the revolting colonies. The immediate outcome
of his arrogant meddling was the loss of Carleton’s
services.</p>

<div class="sidenote">His correspondence
with
Carleton.</div>

<p>On the 22nd of August, 1776, while Carleton was busy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
making preparations to drive the Americans back up Lake
Champlain, Germain wrote to him, commending what had
been done, expressing a hope that the frontiers of Canada
would soon be cleared of the rebel forces, and giving
instructions that, when this task had been accomplished,
Carleton should return to Quebec, to attend to civil duties
and the restoration of law and order, while detaching
Burgoyne with any troops that could be spared to co-operate
with Howe’s army acting from New York. Written
when it was, the letter could hardly have been received in
any case before the year’s campaign was drawing to its
close, and before events had already determined what
could or could not be done. It might have been received,
wrote Carleton in a dignified and reasoned reply, at the
beginning of November,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> and coming to hand then could
only have caused embarrassment. As a matter of fact,
the ship which carried Germain’s letter, was driven back
three times, and Carleton only received a duplicate in
May, 1777, under cover of a second letter from Germain
which was dated the 26th of March in that year. This <span class="sidenote">Carleton censured and superseded in command of the army on the side of Canada.</span>
second letter attributed the disaster to the Hessians at
Trenton, which had happened in the meantime, in part
to the fact that by retreating from before Ticonderoga in
the preceding autumn Carleton had relaxed the pressure
on the American army in front of him, which had thereby
been enabled to reinforce Washington; and it announced
that two expeditions were in the coming campaign to be
sent from Canada, one under Colonel St. Leger, the other
under Burgoyne, while Carleton himself was to remain
behind in Canada and devote his energies to the defence of
the province, and to furnishing supplies and equipment
for the two expeditions in question. It will be remembered
that Burgoyne had in the meantime returned to England,
reaching Portsmouth about the 9th of December, 1776,
and had brought with him Carleton’s plans for the operations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
of 1777, which were therefore well known to Germain
when he wrote in March.</p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine how a responsible minister could
have been at once so ignorant and so unfair as Germain
showed himself to be in this communication. To suppose
that the movement or want of movement on Lake Champlain
could have had any real connexion with the cutting
off of a detachment on the Delaware river, which was
within easy reach of the rest of Howe’s forces, overpowering
in numbers as compared with Washington’s, was at best
wilful blindness to facts. To supersede Carleton in the
supreme command of the troops on the Canadian side was
an act of unwisdom and injustice. It is true that, already
in the previous August, while Carleton was still on the full
tide of success, it had been determined to confine his
authority to Canada, and apparently, in order that his
commission might not clash with that of Howe, to place
under a subordinate officer the troops which were intended
to effect a junction with Howe’s army. But in any case <span class="sidenote">Personal relations of Germain and Carleton.</span>
it is not easy to resist the conclusion that Germain had
some personal grudge against the governor.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> From a
letter written by the King to Lord North in February,
1777, it would seem that, had Germain been given his way,
Carleton would have been recalled, and, writing to
Germain on the 22nd of May, Carleton did not hesitate to
refer to the reports which were set abroad when Germain
took office, to the effect that he intended to remove Carleton
from his appointment, and in the meantime to undermine
his authority. In his answer, dated the 25th of July, 1777,
Germain gave the lie to these allegations, assuring Carleton
that ‘whatever reports you may have heard of my having
any personal dislike to you are without the least foundation.
I have at no time received any disobligation from
you’; he stated categorically that the action which had
been taken for giving Burgoyne an independent command
was by ‘the King’s particular directions’, and he added<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
that the hope that Carleton would in his advance in the
previous autumn penetrate as far as Albany was based
upon the opinions of officers who had served in the country,
and was confirmed by intelligence since received to the
effect that the Americans had intended to abandon Ticonderoga,
if Carleton had attacked it.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> But, whatever
may have been the facts as to the personal relations of
Carleton and Germain, it seems clear that the small-minded
minister in England was bent on ridding himself of the best
man who served England in America.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The case
of Chief
Justice
Livius.</div>

<p>As Germain superseded Carleton in his military command,
so he set aside his advice, and over-rode his appointments
in civil matters. Reference has already been made
to the evil effects produced by appointing unfit men to
legal and judicial offices in Canada. The climax was
reached when Germain in August, 1776, appointed to the
Chief Justiceship of Canada a man named Livius, whose
case attained considerable notoriety in the annals of the
time. Peter Livius seems to have been a foreigner by
extraction. Before the war broke out, he had been a
judge in New Hampshire; and, his appointment having
been abolished, he came back to England with a grievance
against the governor and council, with whom he had been
on bad terms while still holding his judgeship. A provision
in the Quebec Act had annulled all the commissions
given to the judges and other officers in Canada under the
Royal Proclamation of 1763, which that Act superseded:
and the English ministry seems to have taken advantage
of this provision to displace men who had done their work
well, and whose services Carleton desired to retain, substituting
for them unfit nominees from England.</p>

<p>One of the men thus substituted was Livius, for whom
they saw an opportunity of providing in Canada. Lord<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
Dartmouth wrote to Carleton in May, 1775, notifying the
appointment of Livius as a judge of Common Pleas for
the district of Montreal; and in August of the following
year he was promoted by Germain to be Chief Justice
of Canada. Livius succeeded Chief Justice Hey, who had
held the office since 1766, and had in August, 1775, requested
to be allowed to retire after ‘ten years honest,
however imperfect, endeavours to serve the Crown in an
unpleasant and something critical situation’.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Hey was
a man of high standing and character, and had been much
consulted by the Government in passing the Quebec Act.
Livius was a man of a wholly different class. Carleton’s <span class="sidenote">Carleton’s description of Livius.</span>
unflattering description of him in a letter written on the
25th of June, 1778,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> was that he was ‘greedy of power
and more greedy of gain, imperious and impetuous in his
temper, but learned in the ways and eloquence of the New
England provinces, valuing himself in his knowledge how
to manage governors, well schooled, it seems, in business
of this sort’. ‘’Tis unfortunate,’ he wrote in another and
earlier letter, referring apparently to Livius, ‘that your
Lordship should find it necessary for the King’s service
to send over a person to administer justice to this people,
when he understands neither their laws, manners, customs,
nor their language.’<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">He dismisses
him from
office.</div>

<p>Livius’ appointment as Chief Justice apparently did
not take effect till 1777, and he lost no time in making
difficulties. Though paid better than his predecessor, he
protested as to his emoluments and position; he claimed
the powers which had been enjoyed by the Intendant
under the old French régime, and both in his judicial
capacity and as a member of the council, constituted
himself an active opponent of the government. As Chief
Justice, he espoused the cause of a Canadian who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
been arrested and sent to prison for disloyalty by the
Lieutenant-Governor Cramahé, and in the council, in
April, 1778, he brought forward motions directed against
what he held to be illegal and irregular proceedings on
the part of the governor. The result of his attitude was
that on the 1st of May, 1778, Carleton, before he left
Canada, summarily, and without giving any reason, dismissed
him from office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Livius
appeals
to the
King.</div>

<p>Both Livius and Carleton went back to England, and
in September Livius appealed to the King. His appeal
was referred to the Lords Commissioners of Trade and
Plantations, whose report on the case was in turn referred
to the Lords of the Committee of Council for Plantation
Affairs, and with their recommendation was brought
before the King in Privy Council, Livius having in the
course of the inquiry stated his case fully both in person
and in writing, while Carleton declined to appear, and
contented himself with referring to his dispatches and
to the minutes of council. On technical grounds Livius
had a strong case. Appointed by the King, he had been <span class="sidenote">Merits of the case.</span>
dismissed by the governor without any reason being
assigned in the letter of dismissal. His conduct in a
judicial capacity had not been specifically impugned, and
the two motions directed against Carleton, which he had
brought forward in the Legislative Council immediately
prior to his dismissal, had, at any rate, some show of
reason. The first was to the effect that the governor
should communicate to the council the Royal Instructions
which had been given him with respect to legislation, and
which by those instructions he was to communicate so far
as it was convenient for the King’s service. The second
referred to a committee of five members of the council,
which Carleton had constituted in August, 1776, a kind
of Privy Council for the transaction of executive, as
opposed to legislative business, in which Livius was not
included. Livius contended, and his contention was
upheld, that the instruction under which the governor had
appointed this board or committee, did not contemplate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
the formation of a standing committee of particular members
of council, but only authorized the transaction of
executive business by any five councillors, if more were
not available at the time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
appeal
upheld
and
Livius
restored
to office.
His subsequent
career.</div>

<p>The result of the inquiry was that the Chief Justice
was restored to his office, but he never returned to Canada.
In July, 1779, a mandamus for his re-appointment as
Chief Justice was sent to Governor Haldimand, Carleton’s
successor, and in the same month he was ordered to go
back at once to Quebec. But he remained on in England
on one pretext or another. In March, 1780, he was still
in London asking for further extension of leave, to see
his brother who was coming home from India. Two years
later, in April, 1782, he had not gone, though he alleged
that he had attempted to cross the Atlantic and had been
driven back by stress of weather; and he pleaded with
rare audacity that it was advisable that he should still
prolong his absence from Canada, as otherwise it would
be his duty to oppose the high-handed proceedings, as he
deemed them to be, of General Haldimand. So matters
went on until Carleton, now Lord Dorchester, returned to
govern Canada in the autumn of 1786, when a new Chief
Justice was at once appointed, and Livius finally disappeared
from history.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Moral of
the case.</div>

<p>It has been worth while to give at some length the details
of this somewhat squalid incident, because it is a good
illustration of the difficulties which may arise from one
of the most valued and valuable of English principles, the
independence of the judicature. In the distant possessions
of Great Britain, even more than at home, a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
safeguard and a strong source of confidence is and
always has been that the judges are in no way dependent
on the Executive; and yet the case of Livius is by no
means the only case in which serious mischief to the public
service has resulted from this very cause. There can be
no doubt that on technical grounds the Privy Council were
right in upholding Livius’ appeal. What weighed with
them most of all was that Livius had not been dismissed
for judicial misconduct; and short of such misconduct,
flagrant and proved beyond all shadow of doubt, it would
still be held that a judge should not be removed from
office by the King himself, much less by the governor.
Carleton, like other men cast in a large mould, did not
sufficiently safeguard his action. A mischief-making
adventurer was placed in high office for which he was
clearly unfit. At a time of national crisis he used his
powers of making mischief, and feeling secure in the independence
of his judicial position, sought to undermine
the authority of the Government. Unwilling to leave
the difficulty for his successor to solve, the outgoing
governor, fearless of responsibility, summarily dismissed
the man, and contemptuously refused to justify the
grounds of dismissal. He acted in the best interests of
the public service, but, in doing so, he placed himself in
the wrong, and the restoration of Livius to his office must
be held to be justified, while his original appointment admits
of no excuse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carleton
resigns.</div>

<p>In June, 1777, Carleton sent in his resignation, but a
year passed before he was able to leave Canada, and a
bitter year it was for the English cause in America. Germain’s
letter to him of the 26th of March, to which reference
has already been made, gave a minute account of <span class="sidenote">Germain’s plan of campaign for 1777.</span>
the plans for the year’s campaign. Carleton was to
remain behind in Canada with 3,770 men. He was to
place under command of General Burgoyne 7,173 men, in
addition to Canadians and Indians, and after providing
him with whatever artillery, stores, and provisions he
might require, and rendering him every assistance in his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
power, ‘to give him orders to pass Lake Champlain and
from thence, by the most vigorous exertion of the force
under his command, to proceed with all expedition to
Albany, and put himself under the command of Sir William
Howe.’ In an earlier part of the same letter the phrase
is used that Burgoyne was ‘to force his way to Albany’,
leaving no doubt of the writer’s intention that at all
hazards Burgoyne was to effect a junction with Howe.
Carleton was further to place under Lieutenant-Colonel
St. Leger 675 men, also to be supplemented by Canadians
and Indians, to give him all the necessaries for his expedition,
and to instruct him to advance to the Mohawk river,
and down that river to Albany, where he was to place
himself under Sir William Howe. St. Leger’s force was
to be supplementary to Burgoyne’s: as phrased elsewhere
in the same letter, he was ‘to make a diversion on the
Mohawk river’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Minuteness
of
the instructions.</div>

<p class="pbot1">It is noteworthy how this remarkable letter purported
to settle all the details. The exact number of men for
each service are counted, the particular regiments and
companies of regiments are told off, no discretion is left
to Carleton or to Burgoyne as to whom they should send
forward to Lake Champlain or the Mohawk, and whom
they should keep in Canada. No mention is made of the
reinforcements which Carleton had written were necessary.
Nothing is allowed apparently for sick or ineffectives.
All is on paper, concocted by the man at a distance who
persisted in knowing better than the far more capable man
on the spot. But the most damning passage in the letter
is as follows, ‘I shall write to Sir William from hence by <span class="sidenote">Germain fails to communicate with Sir W. Howe.</span>
the first packet, but you will nevertheless endeavour to
give him the earliest intelligence of this measure, and
also direct Lieutenant-General Burgoyne and Lieutenant-Colonel
St. Leger to neglect no opportunity of doing the
same, that they may receive instructions from Sir William
Howe.’ Sir William Howe’s Narrative of his operations,
given to a Committee of the House of Commons in April,
1779, states explicitly that the promised letter was never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
sent to him by Germain; that it was not until the 5th of
June that he received from Carleton a copy of the letter
which has been quoted above, unaccompanied by any
instructions; and that, before Burgoyne left England,
Germain had received Howe’s plans for the Philadelphia
expedition, and had written approving them. Such was
Lord George Germain’s conduct of the war in America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burgoyne
and
Carleton.</div>

<p class="p1">On the 27th of March Burgoyne left London. On the
6th of May he arrived at Quebec. There was no friction
between him and Carleton. He had made no attempt to
supplant Carleton, and, bitterly as Carleton resented his
own treatment by Germain, he gave Burgoyne the utmost
assistance for the coming campaign. ‘Had that officer
been acting for himself or for his brother, he could not
have shown more indefatigable zeal than he did to comply
with and expedite my requisitions and desires.’ Such
was Burgoyne’s testimony to Carleton, in his Narrative
of the ‘state of the Expedition from Canada’ as given to
the House of Commons.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St.
Leger’s
expedition
to
the
Mohawk
river.</div>

<p>Before following the fortunes of Burgoyne and his
army, it will be well to give an account of how St. Leger
fared in the ‘diversion on the Mohawk river’. As in
the days of the French and English wars, the twofold
British advance from Canada followed the course of the
waterways. While the main army moved up Lake Champlain
to strike the Hudson at Fort Edward and thence
move down to Albany, St. Leger’s smaller force was dispatched
up the St. Lawrence to Oswego on Lake Ontario,
in order by lake and stream to reach and overpower Fort
Stanwix on the upper waters of the Mohawk river, and
then to follow down that river to the Hudson, and reach
the meeting-point with Burgoyne’s troops at Albany.
At Albany both Burgoyne and St. Leger were to place
themselves under Sir William Howe’s command. Oswego,
the starting-point of St. Leger’s expedition, owing to its
geographical position always played a prominent part in
the border wars of Canada and the North American colonies.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
From this point Count Frontenac started when, in 1696, <span class="sidenote">Oswego.</span>
he led his men to Onondaga, burnt the villages of the
Iroquois, and laid waste their cornfields. The first fort
at Oswego was built in 1727 by Governor Burnet of New
York, who reported that he had built it with the consent
of the Six Nations. It was built on the western bank of
the mouth of the Onondaga or Oswego river, which here
runs into Lake Ontario, and it was still the main fort in
1756, when Oswego was taken by Montcalm, although
a subsidiary fort had also lately been built upon the
opposite—the eastern side of the river. The effect produced
both in England and in America by the French
general’s brilliant feat of arms marked the importance
which was attached to the position. The place was re-occupied
by Prideaux and Haldimand with Sir William
Johnson in 1759; and subsequently a new fort was constructed
on the high ground which forms a promontory
on the eastern side of the estuary. This fort, which
after the War of Independence passed into American
hands, was stormed and taken by Gordon Drummond in
the war of 1812.</p>

<p>The Oswego river, or one branch of it, runs out of Lake
Oneida: and into that lake, at the eastern end, runs the
stream which was known as Wood Creek. From the Wood
Creek there was a portage to the Mohawk river, and at
the end of the portage stood Fort Stanwix, held by an
American garrison, and barring St. Leger’s way to the
Mohawk valley and the Hudson. All this was the country <span class="sidenote">The Six Nations.</span>
of the Six Nation Indians, Six Nations instead of Five
since the early part of the eighteenth century, when the
Tuscaroras, driven up from the south by the white men,
had been admitted to the Iroquois Confederacy. The <span class="sidenote">Allies of the English.</span>
people of the Long House, as the Iroquois called themselves,
had always been, in the main, allies of the English
as against the French. From the time when the state
of New York became a British possession, these Indians,
who had had friendly trading relations with the Dutch,
transferred their friendship to the English, and the chain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
of the covenant, though often strained, was never completely
broken. When the War of American Independence
began, and the English were divided, the Six Nations,
though confused by the issue and by the competing appeals
of the two parties, adhered as a whole to the Royalist
cause. The majority of the Oneidas, and possibly the
Tuscaroras, inclined to the American side, the Oneidas
having come under the strong personal influence of a New
England missionary, Samuel Kirkland, but the other
members of the league were for the King. After the
battle of Oriskany, where, among others, the powerful
clan of Senecas suffered heavily, the enmity between these
Indians and the colonists became more pronounced, and
took the form of a blood feud, accompanied by all the
horrors of militant savagery.</p>

<p>There were various reasons why the Iroquois should
espouse the side of England against America. They
looked to the Great King beyond the sea as their father
and protector. The English colonists on their borders
had shown little respect for their lands: and in 1774, in
one of the inevitable conflicts between white men and red
on the Virginian frontier, which was known as Cresap’s
war, some of the Six Nation warriors had been involved,
and the family of a friendly Cayuga chief had been murdered
by the whites, bringing bitterness into the hearts of
the western members of the Iroquois Confederacy. But,
most of all, the Mohawks shaped the policy of the league,
and they in turn were guided by the Johnson family, and
by their famous fighting chief Thayandenegea, more
commonly known by his English name of Joseph
Brant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Mohawks.</div>

<p>The Mohawks had always been the leaders among the
Six Nation Indians, though, by the time when war broke
out between England and America, they were comparatively
few in number, worn down by constant fighting, and
by other causes.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Of all the Iroquois, they had been most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
consistently loyal to the English, and the most determined
foes of the French. Their homes were at the eastern end
of the Long House, in the valley of the Mohawk river, and
they had therefore always been in close touch with the
settlements at Albany, Schenectady, and along the course
of the river to which they gave their name. They had
mingled much and intermarried with their white neighbours;
and for thirty-five years they had had living
among them the Englishman, or rather the Irishman,
who above all others won the confidence of the North
American Indians, Sir William Johnson. They adopted <span class="sidenote">Sir William Johnson.</span>
him and he adopted them, taking to wife in his later years,
a Mohawk girl, Mary or Molly Brant. If Johnson in large
measure lived down to the Indians, he also endeavoured
to make the Indians live up to the white men’s level.
He encouraged missionary effort, and promoted education,
sending, among others, Joseph Brant, brother of Molly
Brant, to a school for Indian boys at Lebanon in the
state of Connecticut. Johnson represented the authority
of the King, and he used his authority and his influence
for the protection of the Indians against the inroads of the
white men into their lands. The Mohawks, from their
position, were more exposed than the other members of
the confederacy to white land-jobbers, whose aggressiveness
increased after Johnson’s death in 1774. Accordingly,
while their traditional sympathies had always been
with the English, when the civil war came, they had no
hesitation in attaching themselves to the King’s cause. It
was the cause of their protector; it was the cause of the
Johnson family; it was the cause to which both interest
and sentiment bade them to adhere. When Sir William
Johnson died, he left as his political representative, his
nephew and son-in-law, Colonel Guy Johnson: the heir
of his estates was his own son, Sir John Johnson. Both
the one and the other were pronounced Loyalists: they
drew the Mohawks after them; and when, in the summer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
of 1775, after hearing of the fight at Bunker’s Hill, Guy
Johnson left the Mohawk Valley for Oswego and crossed
over to Canada, the majority of the Mohawks left their
homes and followed him. In Canada, it was said, they
received assurances from Carleton, which were confirmed
by Haldimand, that they should not be allowed to suffer
for their loyalty to the King.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Joseph
Brant.</div>

<p>The leader of these Mohawk friends of England was
Joseph Brant, who was born, the son of a full-blooded
Mohawk, in 1742. He was therefore a man of between
thirty and forty years of age at the time of the American
Revolution. In the period intervening between the
British conquest of Canada and the battle of Waterloo,
North America produced three very remarkable men of
pure Indian descent. Pontiac was one, Joseph Brant was
the second, the third was Tecumseh, who fought and fell
in the war of 1812. Of these three, Joseph Brant alone
sprang from the famous Iroquois stock. Pontiac was to
a greater extent than the others a leader of the red men
against the whites. So far as he had sympathies with white
men, they were with the French as against the English.
Brant, in the main, and Tecumseh played their parts when
French rule had ceased to exist in North America;
they were fast allies of the English as against the
Americans or, to put it more accurately, of the English
controlled from home as against the English installed in
their own right in America. But all these three Indian
chiefs had, in one form or another, the same main motive
for action, to prevent what the red man had being taken
from him by the white man. Of the three, Brant was by
far the most civilized. He was an educated man and a
Christian. He was, as has been seen, sent to school in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
Connecticut, he was a friend of the missionaries, he visited
England twice, went to Court, had interviews and correspondence
with Secretaries of State, made acquaintance
with Boswell, was painted by Romney, and was presented
by Fox with a silver snuff-box. He was poles asunder
from the ordinary native inhabitant of the North American
backwoods. He had known war from early boyhood, had
borne arms under Sir William Johnson against the French,
and had apparently fought against Pontiac. At the outbreak
of the revolution he followed Guy Johnson to
Canada, and seems to have taken part in opposing the
American advance on Montreal. He paid his first visit to
England towards the end of 1775, returned to New York
in July 1776, and before the year closed made his way back
up country to the lands belonging to or within striking
distance of the Six Nations. Throughout the coming years
of the war his name was great and terrible in the borderland,
the main scene of his warfare being what was then
known as the Tryon county of New York, the districts
east of the Fort Stanwix treaty line, which were watered
by the Mohawk river and its tributaries, and by the streams
which flow south and south-west to form the Susquehanna.
Once portrayed as the embodiment of ruthless ferocity,
Brant was afterwards given a place in history as a hero.
He was present at the Cherry Valley massacre, but in his
fighting he seems to have been beyond question more
humane than most Indian warriors, and at least as
humane as some white men in these border wars, while his
courage, his skill in bush-fighting, and his rapidity of
movement were never surpassed. He was not a devil, and
not an angel. Like other men, both coloured and white,
he no doubt acted from mixed motives. His friendship
for the English, and his patriotism for the native races,
may well have been coupled with personal ambition. But
he fought heart-whole and with no little chivalry for the
cause which he espoused; and in war, as in peace, he was
above and beyond the normal level of the North American
Indian. After the war was over, he settled with his people<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
in Canada, where he died in 1807, and the town of Brantford
preserves his name.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St.
Leger’s
force too
small for
the task.</div>

<p>St. Leger’s expedition had been suggested to Germain
by Burgoyne, while the latter was in England: indeed,
some enterprise of the kind had been contemplated by
Carleton. In view alike of past history and of the general
plan of the summer’s campaign, it had much to recommend
it; but the opposition which the English were likely to
encounter, and actually did encounter, was under-rated,
and the force was too small for the task imposed upon it.
The total number has usually been given at 1,700 men,
including Indians; but this seems to have been an over-estimate,
at any rate when the fighting came. The white
troops probably did not in any case exceed 650 in number.
There were only 200 British regulars, half of whom
were a detachment of the 8th, now the King’s (Liverpool
Regiment), the same regiment which had furnished a company
for the attack on the Cedars. There were a few
German troops, who had just arrived in Canada, and
some of whom did not reach Oswego until the expedition
was over. The Germans, being wholly ignorant of the
country, were quite unsuited for bush-fighting and
bateau-work. There was a corps of New York Loyalists
under the command of Sir John Johnson, and known as
Johnson’s Royal Greens. Colonel John Butler led a company
of the Rangers, and a small body of Canadians also
took part in the expedition. The Indian contingent
numbered over 800 men. Brant joined at Oswego at the
head of 300 Indian warriors, mostly Mohawks, and the
Senecas were much in evidence. The Indians, as a whole,
were under the command of Colonel Daniel Claus, Johnson’s
brother-in-law, who for many years was one of the
officers charged by the British Government with the
superintendence of Indian affairs. Thus St. Leger had
with him most of the men whose names are best known
on the British side in the annals of the border warfare in
these troubled times. Guns were taken with the force,
though of too small calibre to overpower a well-built fort;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
and, when the advance began towards the end of July, no
precautions were neglected, a detachment was sent on a
day’s march or so in front of the main column, and the
latter was led and flanked on either side by Indians.</p>

<p>Fort Stanwix had at the time been renamed Fort
Schuyler by the Americans, presumably in honour of
General Schuyler, who commanded the American forces
in the Northern Department. The older and better known
name was subsequently restored. The fort stood on the
Mohawk river, not actually on the bank of the river, but
about 300 yards distant, guarding the end of the portage
from Wood Creek. The length of the portage where the
two rivers were nearest to each other, was rather over a
mile.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> The old blockhouse, Fort Williams, which had
been the predecessor of the existing fort, and the ruins of
which were standing at the time of St. Leger’s expedition,
was destroyed by the English general, Daniel Webb, in
1756, as he retreated in hot haste on hearing of the capture
of Oswego by Montcalm. Two years later General Stanwix
built a new fort, which bore his own name. The
town of Rome now covers the site on which Fort Stanwix
stood. The fort was square in form. It had evidently
been carefully designed by a trained soldier and strongly
constructed, but during the years of peace, in this case as
in those of the other border forts, the defences had fallen
more or less into decay, and had not been fully repaired or
rebuilt when the siege began. None the less, they proved
to be too strong to be overpowered by St. Leger’s light
guns. The garrison consisted of 750 men, 200 of whom
came in, bringing stores and provisions, on the very day
on which the forerunners of St. Leger’s force appeared on
the scene. The commander of the garrison was Colonel
Gansevoort, the second in command was Colonel Willett, <span class="sidenote">Fort Stanwix.</span>
both thoroughly competent men.</p>

<p>St. Leger’s advanced guard, consisting of a detachment
of 30 men of the 8th Regiment, under Lieutenant Bird,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
with 200 Indians under Brant, arrived before the fort on <span class="sidenote">The siege of Fort Stanwix begins.</span>
the 2nd of August. They had been sent on, as is told in
St. Leger’s dispatch, ‘to seize fast hold of the lower landing-place,
and thereby cut off the enemy’s communication
with the lower country.’<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> It had been hoped that they
would be in time to intercept the reinforcements which
were due at the fort, but they arrived too late for this
purpose. They took up their position at the point named,
below and due south of the fort, on the bank of the
Mohawk river, athwart the road to Albany. On the
following day, the 3rd of August, St. Leger came up himself,
sent a proclamation into the fort, and began to
invest it, fixing his main encampment about half a mile
to the north-east of the fort, and higher up the river,
which here runs in a curving course, so that a straight line
drawn from the main British camp to the post at the lower
landing-place would cross and recross the river, forming
the base of a semi-circle. The Americans had blocked up
Wood Creek with fallen timber, and St. Leger reported
that it took nine days and the work of 110 men to clear
away the obstructions, while two days were spent in
making several miles of track through the woods in order
in the meantime to bring up stores and guns. The siege,
therefore, began long before the necessary preparations
had been made, and long before the besieging force had
been concentrated and duly entrenched. On the evening
of the 5th of August there were not 250 of the white troops
in camp, and at this juncture St. Leger was threatened by
a strong body of Americans who had gathered for the
relief of the fort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The fight
at Oriskany.</div>

<p>When news came to the New York settlements of the
British advance, the militia of Tryon county were called
out by their commander, General Nicholas Herkimer.
The rendezvous was Fort Dayton, at the German Flatts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
lower down the Mohawk valley than Fort Stanwix. The
German Flatts were so named after settlers from the
Palatinate, who had come out early in the eighteenth
century, and from this stock Herkimer was himself
descended. On the 4th of August he moved forward, the
number of his force being usually given at from 800 to 1,000
men. St. Leger reported that they were 800 strong, and
assuming that the total was between 700 and 800, the
relief force and the garrison together equalled, if they did
not outnumber, the whole of St. Leger’s army, the majority
of which moreover consisted, as has been seen, of Indians.
On the 5th Herkimer encamped near a place called
Oriskany, about eight<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> miles short of Fort Stanwix, where
a stream called the Oriskany Creek flowed into the Mohawk
river. From this point he sent on messengers to the fort
to secure the co-operation of the garrison. Meanwhile
intelligence had reached St. Leger, sent it was said by
Molly Brant, of the coming relief force, and at five o’clock
on the evening of the 5th he dispatched 80 white
troops, being all that he could spare, with 400 Indians, to
intercept the advancing Americans before they came into
touch with the fort, and ambush them among the woods.
Sir John<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> Johnson was placed in command of the detachment,
and with him were Butler and Joseph Brant. It
was work for which Brant was eminently suited, and he
seems to have been the leading spirit in planning the
ambuscade. Very early on the morning of the 6th of
August, urged on by his impatient followers, and against
his own better judgement, Herkimer, without waiting for
reinforcements or for a sign from the beleaguered fort,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
continued his advance. He reached a point between two
and three miles beyond Oriskany, and within six miles of
the fort, where the path descended into a semi-circular
ravine, with swampy ground at the bottom and high
wooded ground at the sides. Here the Americans were
caught in a trap, which would have been more complete
had not the Indians begun fighting before the plan of
ambush had been fully developed. The American rearguard,
which had not yet entered the ravine, broke and
fled: the main body were surrounded, Johnson barring
their way in front, Brant falling on their rear, while others
of the Indians and Butler’s rangers fought on the flanks.
There followed a confused fight among the trees, gradually
becoming a hand to hand struggle, with a brief interlude
caused by a heavy storm of rain. Herkimer was mortally
wounded, many, if not most, of the other leading American
officers were killed; while, on the British side, the Indians
suffered heavy losses. In the end the remnant of the
American force seem to have beaten off or tired out their
assailants, and made good their retreat, but according
to St. Leger’s report only 200 of them escaped. Butler
estimated the total American casualties in killed, wounded,
and prisoners, at 500, and, according to American accounts,
the total was about 400. The white casualties on the
British side were very small, but the casualties among the
Indians seem to have numbered from 60 to 100.</p>

<p>While the engagement was going on, a sortie was made
from the fort, and it was probably news of this movement,
coupled with the Indian losses, which put an end to the
fight at Oriskany. Bird, the commander of the post at
the lower landing-place, had been misled by a rumour that
Johnson was hard pressed, and led out his men to support
him, leaving the post undefended. Meanwhile, Willett
at the head of 250 men marched out of the fort, apparently
in ignorance of the ambuscade and designing to join hands
with Herkimer’s force. Willett found the post practically
deserted, mastered it, and carried off its contents, eluding
an attempt which St. Leger made to cut him off on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
return to the fort.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> This ended the day’s work. Herkimer’s
force had been blotted out, but it must have become
increasingly evident that St. Leger’s men and resources
were hopelessly inadequate for the task which had been
set him, to force his way to Albany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">St. Leger
fails to
take Fort
Stanwix
and retreats
to
Oswego.</div>

<p>After the battle of Oriskany, St. Leger summoned the
fort to surrender, but without effect. He continued the
siege, but made little or no impression upon the defences.
On the night of the 10th of August Willett made his way
out of the fort, reached Fort Dayton, and went on to
Albany where he met Benedict Arnold who had been
charged with the duty of relieving Fort Stanwix. Arnold
gathered troops for the purpose and in the meantime,
with his usual cleverness, contrived to send on rumours
which caused alarm in the British camp. A thousand
men were reported to be coming, then 2,000, then 3,000,
and Arnold’s own name may well have been a potent
source of apprehension. The Indians, already depressed
by their losses at Oriskany, and by the prolonging of
the siege, became more and more out of hand, deserting,
marauding, and spreading exaggerated tales; and
at length, on the 22nd or 23rd of August, St. Leger
beat a hasty retreat by night, leaving behind him most
of his stores and guns, and returned to Oswego, whence
he went back to Montreal and on to Lake Champlain in
the wake of Burgoyne’s army. Joseph Brant took a less
circuitous route. When St. Leger retreated from Fort
Stanwix, Brant made one of his marvellous flying marches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
down the Mohawk Valley: and, after passing for over
a hundred miles through the heart of the enemy’s country,
which was also his own, in two or three days’ time joined
Burgoyne’s force on the banks of the Hudson river.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Misconduct
of the
Indians.</div>

<p>When he returned to Oswego, St. Leger, on the 27th of
August, wrote a dispatch to Burgoyne, giving details of
his expedition, but not punctuating his failure. The
failure was due to insufficiency of numbers and artillery
in the first place, and in the second, beyond question, to
the misconduct of his Indian allies. The employment of <span class="sidenote">Bad effects of employing them in the war.</span>
Indians in this war with British colonists may have been
inevitable, but it was certainly politically inexpedient,
notwithstanding the fact that the colonists themselves
were ready to avail themselves of similar aid. Indians
had been engaged on the English side in the wars with the
French, but sparingly and under strict supervision.
Carleton, as long as he directed operations in the War of
Independence, had been equally careful in using these
savage tools.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> In St. Leger’s expedition the disadvantages
of enlisting Indian fighting men came fully to light.
They became, St. Leger wrote to Burgoyne, ‘more formidable
than the enemy we had to expect.’ Disappointed
of looting the enemy, they plundered their friends and
endangered, if they did not in some cases take, their lives.
Unstable as friends, ferocious as foes, they were not fit
helpmates for Englishmen in fighting Englishmen, even
their value as scouts was diminished by their incurable
habit of believing and exaggerating any report. As in the
war with the French in Canada, the English gained ground
by the scrupulous care which they took to prevent outrages
on the part of the savages who accompanied their armies,
so in the later war with their own countrymen, they distinctly
lost ground through calling out the coloured men
of America against colonists of British birth.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burgoyne’s
address
to the
Indians.</div>

<p>Burgoyne’s instructions from Lord George Germain
included the employment of Indians under due precautions;
and he formally addressed his Indian followers in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
his camp at the river Bouquet, on the western side of Lake
Champlain, on the 21st of June, 1777. ‘The collective
voices and hands of the Indian tribes over this vast continent,’
were, he told them, with a few exceptions, ‘on the
side of justice, of law, and the King.’ He bade them ‘go
forth in might of your valour and your cause: strike at
the common enemies of Great Britain and America’.
On the other hand, he sternly forbade bloodshed except in
battle, and enjoined that ‘aged men, women, children, and
prisoners must be held sacred from the knife or hatchet,
even in the time of actual conflict’. Compensation would
be given for the prisoners taken, but the Indians would
be called to account for scalps. His listeners replied,
through an old chief of the Iroquois—‘We have been
tried and tempted by the Bostonians, but we have loved
our father, and our hatchets have been sharpened upon
our affections.’ They promised with one voice obedience
to the general’s commands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burgoyne.</div>

<p>At this date, in the year 1777, Burgoyne was fifty-five
years of age, having been born in 1722, two years before
Carleton was born. He was clearly a man of ability,
and unusually versatile. He was also, as times went, an
honourable man. In his relations to Carleton, at any
rate, he seems to have been open to no reproach. But
he tried too many things to be first-rate in anything; he
was not adequate to a great crisis and to heavy responsibility:
and because he was not of the first class, and also
because he had much dramatic instinct, he seems to have
had more eye for present effect than for the root of
matters. He was educated at Westminster School, and,
when he died in 1792, he was buried in the northern
cloister of Westminster Abbey. He was a soldier, a
politician, a dramatist, and a man of society. He entered
the army in 1740, again two years before Carleton’s
military service began. He became so involved in debt
that he had to sell his commission. He rejoined the army
in 1756, and in 1762 he distinguished himself in Portugal,
where the English supported the Portuguese against Spain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
and France. A few years later, however, in 1769, Junius
referred to him as ‘not very conspicuous in his profession’.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
He went into the House of Commons in 1761 as member
for Midhurst. In 1768, through the influence of his father-in-law,
Lord Derby, he became member for Preston, and,
in connexion with his election, was attacked by Junius
for corruption and also for his gambling propensities.
As a politician he was, before he went to America, more or
less of a free-lance. He spoke on foreign and Indian
questions, and in 1773 made a speech in the House of
Commons, attacking Clive. After the catastrophe at
Saratoga, and his return to England, he threw in his lot
with the Whigs, having been befriended by Fox and his
followers; he became Commander-in-Chief in Ireland
under Rockingham; and in 1787 he managed the impeachment
of Warren Hastings. Before the American war
broke out, he produced in 1774 a play called <i>The Maid of
the Oaks</i>, of which Horace Walpole wrote: ‘There is a
new puppet show at Drury Lane as fine as scenes can make
it, called <i>The Maid of the Oaks</i>, and as dull as the author
could not help making it.’<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> At a later date, however,
Walpole had to confess that ‘General Burgoyne has
written the best modern comedy’.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> This was <i>The Heiress</i>,
which was brought out in the beginning of 1786, and
achieved a great success. Walpole had no love for
Burgoyne, at any rate at the time when the latter served
in America. ‘You ask the history of Burgoyne the pompous,’
he wrote in October, 1777,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> the month in which the
surrender at Saratoga took place; and after describing
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>him as ‘a fortunate gamester’, he continued, ‘I have
heard him speak in Parliament, just as he writes: for all
his speeches were written and laboured, and yet neither
in them nor in his conversation did he ever impress me
with an idea of his having parts.’ Burgoyne’s affectation
and mannerism may have been due to the fact that he
was essentially a man of society, as society was then. He
had eloped in early life with Lord Derby’s daughter, and,
like Charles Fox, was a confirmed gambler. The world
of London was his world, and the standard by which he
measured things was not the standard of all time. When
he went out in 1777 to command the expedition from
Canada, he was on the flowing tide of fortune, and the
tone of his proclamations gave Walpole cause for sarcastic
comment. ‘Have you read General Burgoyne’s rhodomontade,
in which he almost promises to cross America
in a hop, step, and a jump?’[136] ‘Burgoyne has sent over
a manifesto that if he was to over-run ten provinces would
appear too pompous.’[136] ‘I heard to-day at Richmond
that Julius Caesar Burgonius’s Commentaries are to be
published in an Extraordinary Gazette of three-and-twenty
pages in folio to-morrow—a counterpart to the
<i>Iliad</i> in a nutshell.’<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> All these three passages were written
in August, 1777, while Burgoyne’s expedition was proceeding.
The writer of them did not like Burgoyne, and did
not like the war in which Burgoyne was engaged; but,
though Burgoyne lent himself to criticism and lacked the
qualities which the time and place demanded, his story is
by no means the story either of a bad soldier or of a bad
man; it is rather the story of a second-rate man set
with inadequate means to solve a problem of first-rate
importance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burgoyne’s
advance
against
Ticonderoga.</div>

<p class="pbot1">Having completed his preparations, Burgoyne reached
Crown Point on the 26th of June, preparatory to attacking
Ticonderoga. The full control of the operations had
passed into his own hands, for, by Germain’s instructions,
Carleton’s authority was limited by the boundary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
line of Canada, and that line was drawn far north of Crown
Point and Ticonderoga, cutting the outlet of Lake Champlain
near the point of land named Point au Fer. The
total force amounted to rather over 7,000 men, nearly half
of whom were Germans under the command of Baron
Riedesel. The advance was made on both sides of the
lake, the Germans being on the eastern shore, the British
on the western—the side on which were Crown Point
and Ticonderoga. The Americans, too, held positions on <span class="sidenote">The American position at Ticonderoga.</span>
both sides of the lake, for, over against the peninsula on
which Ticonderoga stood, there jutted out another point
of land, described in Burgoyne’s dispatch as ‘high and
circular’, but in reality rather oblong in form, rising well
above the level of the lake and skirted in part on the land
side by a rivulet. It was called Mount Independence,
and was strongly held and fortified. The lake, here
narrowed to a river, is about a quarter of a mile across,
and between Ticonderoga and Mount Independence a
bridge had been constructed, consisting of sunken timber
piers connected by floating timber, the whole being guarded
in front by a heavy boom of wood strengthened by iron
rivets and chains.</p>

<p class="p1">The Indian name Ticonderoga signified the confluence
of three waters. At this point the long narrow southern
arm of Lake Champlain, coming in from the south-east,
meets the stream which carries out the waters of Lake
George into the third water, the main lake Champlain.
The outlet of Lake George describes a complete semi-circle,
and runs into Lake Champlain due west and east. The
direct route therefore from Lake Champlain to Lake
George runs well to the west of and inside the peninsula
of Ticonderoga, cutting the semi-circular stream without
touching the peninsula. In this consisted the weakness
of the American position: unless the works were extended
further afield than they had men to hold them, part of
the attacking force could pass them by and invest Ticonderoga
on the southern as well as on the northern
side, blocking retreat by the line of Lake George. So<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
it happened when Burgoyne’s army came on the
scene.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burgoyne’s
operations
against
Ticonderoga.</div>

<p>After three days’ stay at Crown Point to bring up all his
forces, the general on the 30th of June moved forward his
leading corps on either side of the lake, and on the next
day the whole army followed. On the 2nd of July the
Americans were reported to have abandoned the post
which guarded the bridge over the river from Lake George,
to the west of Ticonderoga, where saw-mills stood and
which was the starting-point of the ‘carrying place’
from Lake Champlain to Lake George. They abandoned
it, in order to concentrate their strength against the
English advance on the north-west. Burgoyne immediately
moved forward his troops and, driving the enemy
back, on the night of the 2nd occupied the high ground on
the west which commanded the communications with
Lake George, and thereby cut off the possibility of retreat
in that direction. On the 3rd and 4th the attacking
forces drew nearer to the two beleaguered forts, in spite
of cannonade; and on the night of the 4th, a party of
light infantry occupied a height called Sugar Hill, which
stood on the southern bank of the outlet from Lake George,
in the angle between that stream and the southern arm
of Lake Champlain, overlooking and commanding both
Ticonderoga and Mount Independence at an estimated
distance of about 1,400 and 1,500 yards respectively.
On the 5th guns were being brought up to the hill, but, <span class="sidenote">The Americans evacuate their position,</span>
when the morning of the 6th came, it was found that the
American general, St. Clair, had carried his troops across
by the bridge from Ticonderoga, and, having evacuated
both that post and Mount Independence, was retreating
by land and water.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and are
followed
up by the
English.</div>

<p>By land and water Burgoyne’s men followed on the
same day, the bridge and boom being broken for the
gunboats to pass through. At Skenesborough, where the
navigation of Lake Champlain ends, the enemy’s vessels
were taken or destroyed by the British squadron, and the
detachment of Americans who held the fort set fire to it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
and retreated to Fort Anne. Meanwhile, diverging to the
east in the direction of Castleton on the road to Connecticut,
General Fraser, commanding the van of the troops
who pursued by land, followed hard throughout the 6th
upon the American rearguard; Riedesel came up behind
him with supports; but, by agreement between the two
commanders, Fraser, when night fell, bivouacked three
miles in front of his colleague. Early on the 7th he
attacked the Americans, who outnumbered his own troops,
near a place named Huberton, and was on the point of
being beaten back when the arrival of Riedesel converted
a repulse into a victory. The colonists were broken, their
leader, Colonel Francis, and some 200 of his men were
killed, about the same number were taken prisoners, and
a large number of wounded were supposed to have lost
their lives in the woods. Having completed the rout, on
the 8th and 9th Riedesel and Fraser came into touch with
the main army at Skenesborough.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fight
near Fort
Anne.</div>

<p>At Skenesborough there was a portage from Lake
Champlain to Wood Creek,<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> a stream which flows into
the lake from the south. While boats were being dragged
across from the lake to the river with a view to further
advance, the 9th Regiment was sent on by land to Fort
Anne, twelve miles distant in a due southerly direction.
By the evening of the 7th the English drew near to the
fort, and on the following day they were attacked and
hard pressed by a stronger body of Americans. They took
up a position on a hill, and held their ground resolutely,
until the whoop of Indians told that reinforcements were
coming up: the Americans then gave way, and, setting
fire to Fort Anne, fell back to Fort Edward. The English
in their turn returned to Skenesborough, in the neighbourhood
of which, on the 9th and 10th of July, the whole
army, excluding the troops required to garrison Ticonderoga,
was concentrated, the line extending eastward
from the head of Lake Champlain towards Castleton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Result
of the
operations.</div>

<p>‘General Burgoyne has taken Ticonderoga, and given
a new complexion to the aspect of affairs, which was very
wan indeed,’ wrote Horace Walpole, when the news
reached England.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> So far the operations had been
triumphantly successful. Hardly an attempt had been
made by the Americans to hold their ground at Ticonderoga
and Mount Independence, although months had been
spent in strengthening the positions, and the number of
the defenders was variously estimated at from 3,000 to
5,000 men. Great quantities of stores, of boats, of guns
had fallen into British hands: the enemy’s loss on the
retreat had been heavy, and the rapidity with which the
retreat had been followed up had caused widespread
alarm. For the moment there seemed nothing to check
the tide of British victory, but time, place, and insufficiency
of numbers gradually told against Burgoyne’s
enterprise. He, too, had suffered some losses, though
small when compared with those of the Americans; and
his army, already inadequate in numbers for the expedition,
was further weakened by the necessity of garrisoning
Ticonderoga with some 900 men. He applied to Carleton
to supply the requisite number of soldiers for the garrison
from the troops who, in accordance with the instructions
from home, were retained for the defence of Canada, but
Carleton felt himself bound to refuse the request. It was
Germain who had given the orders, and yet the same man,
writing from England in the following September, on
receipt of Burgoyne’s account of the capture of Ticonderoga,
stated that he presumed that the post would be
garrisoned from Canada.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The two
routes
to the
Hudson.</div>

<p>Burgoyne’s objective was the Hudson river and Albany.
Fort Edward stood on the left or eastern bank of the
Hudson, a little below the point where that river curves to
the south, to flow direct to the Atlantic. It was twenty-six
miles distant from Skenesborough, and due south of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
that place. The first twelve miles of the route from
Skenesborough lay along Wood Creek, until Fort Anne
was reached, and from Fort Anne to Fort Edward was an
interval of fourteen miles. Three miles short of Fort
Edward the road joined the road to Fort Edward from
Fort George, previously known as Fort William Henry, at
the head of Lake George, which was at much the same
distance from Fort Edward as Fort Anne, viz., fourteen
to sixteen miles. The more obvious route of advance
towards the Hudson from Ticonderoga, and the one
originally contemplated, was along Lake George, and <span class="sidenote">Burgoyne’s line of advance.</span>
Burgoyne was criticized for not taking that line—without
good reason, because the American retreat had already
determined the choice of routes. Having immediately
followed the enemy up as far as Skenesborough, Burgoyne,
as he justly pointed out, would have been unwise to make
a retrograde movement in order to adopt the alternative
line of advance by Lake George. Moreover, while the
troops were moving forward from Skenesborough viâ
Wood Creek and Fort Anne, supplies were being forwarded
along Lake George in order to meet him when he reached
Fort Edward. But there was a further reason, which in <span class="sidenote">His object was to threaten the New England States.</span>
Burgoyne’s mind made for the more easterly of the two
routes. His own scheme for the campaign had inclined
to carrying war to the east into Connecticut and the New
England states, in preference to a direct advance to the
Hudson and Albany; and, though his instructions prevented
his carrying out the plan which he preferred, he
might yet, as he advanced, threaten New England, and at
the same time gather supplies from a more promising
country than would be found in the Adirondack region on
the west of Lake George. Thus in a private letter to
Germain, which accompanied his dispatch from Skenesborough,
detailing the success of his recent operations,
he wrote: ‘I a little lament that my orders do not give
me the latitude I ventured to propose in my original
project for the campaign, to make a real effort instead of
a feint upon New England. As things have turned out,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
were I at liberty to march in force immediately by my
left, instead of by my right, I should have little doubt
of subduing before winter the provinces where the rebellion
originated.’ It must be remembered that at this time
British troops were in occupation of Rhode Island, and
that Sir William Howe had originally planned a campaign
in New England in 1777, only giving up the scheme
when he found that sufficient reinforcements from Europe
would not be forthcoming.</p>

<p>It was with the object of keeping the New England
States in fear of invasion, or, as he himself phrased it,
‘of giving jealousy to Connecticut, and keeping in check
the whole country called the Hampshire Grants,’<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> that
Burgoyne, while encamped at Skenesborough, detached
Riedesel to occupy Castleton about fourteen miles to <span class="sidenote">Riedesel sent to Castleton.</span>
the east. Castleton was an important point, because
through it ran a road which connected Skenesborough by
land with the shore of Lake Champlain opposite Ticonderoga
and Crown Point. Riedesel was absent for about
twelve days, and in the meantime preparations were
pressed forward for a further advance of the main army,
the road to Fort Anne and the parallel waterway of Wood
Creek being cleared of obstructions. Simultaneous preparations
were made at Ticonderoga for forwarding supplies
by Lake George. On the 23rd of July the advanced
guard moved forward to Fort Anne: on the 25th the
whole army had reached that point; on the 29th, the
van arrived at Fort Edward, which the Americans had
already evacuated, and on the 30th Burgoyne arrived
at the same place. A large convoy of provisions sent
by Lake George reached the head of that lake by the
29th, Fort George like Fort Edward having been abandoned <span class="sidenote">The army arrives at Fort Edward on the Hudson river.</span>
by the enemy, who had carried off their stores.
Thus the end of July found Burgoyne on the Hudson,
well on his way to Albany; the main difficulties of the
expedition seemed to be past; but as a matter of fact the
most trying time was yet to come. His communications<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
were insecure, for he could not spare men to guard them.
His transport was inadequate, and so were his supplies.
Delay in bringing up stores meant time to the Americans
to recover their spirits and gather in his front: he had
no tidings from Howe, and no sure knowledge of St.
Leger’s progress. He only knew that at all hazards
he was expected to make his way to Albany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The beginning
of misfortunes.
Murder
of Jane
McCrae
by the
Indians.</div>

<p>While he halted at Fort Edward, two untoward incidents
took place. The first was a brutal murder by Indians
of a young white woman named Jane McCrae, who had
remained behind at or near Fort Edward, when the
Congress troops fell back before Burgoyne’s advance.
The story went that she was engaged and about to be
married to an officer in Burgoyne’s army. Falling into
the hands of the Indians, she was murdered with purposeless,
savage fury, and the tale of the outrage, embellished
with horrors, was spread far and wide through the land.
Colonists hitherto inclined to the loyal cause, felt that
their homes and womenkind would not be safe, if they
awaited the coming of the English and their savage
allies: the opponents of England found additional
justification for the stand which they had taken up;
the sympathizers with the American cause in England
were given a new text for denouncing the war; and
Burgoyne lost Indian support by taking steps to prevent
a recurrence of such enormities.</p>

<p>The second misfortune which happened—a most grave
misfortune—was an unsuccessful expedition in the direction
of Bennington. Bennington is in the state of Vermont, <span class="sidenote">The expedition to Bennington.</span>
to the south-east of Fort Edward, lying about twenty-four
miles due east of the stretch of the Hudson river, between
Saratoga on the north and the confluence of the Mohawk
on the south, which was known as Stillwater. It is in
the forks of the two streams which combine to form
the Hoosick river, a tributary of the Hudson, flowing <span class="sidenote">Objects aimed at by the expedition.</span>
into the main river from the east. Burgoyne’s information
was to the effect, quoting his own words, that it was
‘the great deposit of corn, flour, and store cattle’,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
intended for the use of the Congress troops, which he
designed to secure for his own army in view of the difficulty
and delay experienced in bringing up supplies from Canada.
The German general, Riedesel, seems to have originally
suggested such an expedition, from knowledge gained
while he was stationed at Castleton. He was anxious to
obtain horses to mount his men and to carry the baggage;
there was evidence of a considerable Loyalist element
in the population, and little reason to apprehend strong
opposition from the colonial militia. Above all Burgoyne
had constantly in his mind the object of threatening the
New England states: and, having by this time received
intelligence that St. Leger was before Fort Stanwix,
he wished to make a diversion to the east, in order to
prevent reinforcements being sent up the Mohawk river
to the relief of that post. The instructions which he
issued for the expedition show that he contemplated
that the detached force, if things went well, would
penetrate far beyond Bennington, up to the Connecticut
river, and possibly not rejoin the main army until the
latter had reached Albany.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Strength
and composition
of the
force.</div>

<p>About 500 men, according to his dispatch, were detailed
for the enterprise, but the number appears to have been
larger.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> It was a mixed body. There was a strong contingent
of Germans, chiefly dismounted dragoons, ill suited
for a cross-country march, and there were also picked
marksmen from the British regiments, Canadians, provincials,
and about 100 Indians. Out of compliment
to Riedesel, the command was given to Colonel Baum, <span class="sidenote">Colonel Baum in command.</span>
one of his officers, and in selecting German troops for
the expedition, Burgoyne marked his appreciation of
the good service which those regiments had rendered
in following up the retreat of the Americans from Ticonderoga.
The starting-point was the Batten Kill stream,
running into the Hudson on its eastern side, ten miles
lower down than Fort Edward. From this point to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
Bennington, by the route which Baum was finally
instructed to take, was a distance of under thirty miles.
The advance guard of Burgoyne’s army had already
been moved down the Hudson to the Batten Kill, and,
on the 14th of August, after Baum had started, they
were thrown across the main river a little higher up
under the command of General Fraser, and moved forward
on the western bank as far as Saratoga, with the object
of a further advance to Stillwater in the event of Baum’s
expedition proving successful. The temporary bridge of
rafts, however, by which they had crossed, being carried
away, the troops were recalled and passed back in boats
to the eastern side.</p>

<p>Baum started from the Batten Kill early on the morning
of the 13th of August, reached a place called Cambridge
in the afternoon of that day, and on the following day
arrived at Sancoick Mill near the confluence of the two
branches of the Hoosick river, about four miles short
of Bennington. There he found that the enemy in front
of him were more numerous than had been anticipated,
and he sent back to Burgoyne for reinforcements. Colonel <span class="sidenote">Reinforcements sent under Colonel Breyman.</span>
Breyman, another German officer, was dispatched to his
support with nearly 700 men: he started early on the
morning of the 15th, but, owing to the difficulties of
the route, and want of horses and forage, he made slow
way, and was far short of Baum when evening came.
On the 16th a number of men, as from the country side, <span class="sidenote">Baum’s force surprised and cut up.</span>
came to where Baum was encamped: they were taken
to be friends and Loyalists, and made their way within
his lines. On a sudden, while beginning to move forward,<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
he found himself attacked on all sides: the component
parts of his little force were separated from each other,
and only the German soldiers held together, fighting
bravely, as long as they had powder left, and then vainly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
endeavouring to cut their way out with their swords.
The end was inevitable. The Indians dispersed in the
woods: some of the British contingent with their commander,
Captain Frazer, escaped, and so did a good many
of the Canadians and provincials: but Baum was mortally <span class="sidenote">Baum mortally wounded.</span>
wounded, and nearly all of his Brunswickers were killed
or captured. On the afternoon of the same day, ignorant
of what had happened, Breyman’s force was coming <span class="sidenote">Breyman attacked and forced to retreat with heavy loss.</span>
up and was in turn suddenly attacked. Again the
men fought hard until their ammunition gave out, and
eventually the main body made good their retreat, though
they suffered heavy losses and had to leave their guns behind.
John Stark was the leader of the Americans in these
hard fought engagements.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consequences
of the
disaster.</div>

<p>The immediate result of the fighting was the loss
to the English of over 500 men and four guns,<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> and the
total failure of the expedition. The ultimate effect was
much more serious. Burgoyne’s small army was still
further reduced: his hope of securing supplies and
horses from the surrounding country was entirely gone;
his expectation of Loyalist support, upon which the
English had counted, was shown to be groundless; the
chance of facilitating the main operations by a successful
diversion was lost; the enemy were put in good heart;
and such fickle allies as the Indians were further alienated.
The enterprise was subsequently made the subject of
much hostile criticism, and blame was variously assigned.
Burgoyne considered that the failure was due to the
fact that Baum had not taken up a position in the open
in accordance with instructions, to the chance co-operation
of bodies of the enemy who happened to be near, and to
undue slowness on Breyman’s part. The truth seems
to have been that the expedition was not badly conceived,
but imperfect knowledge of the country and faulty
intelligence as to the enemy’s strength and movements
in this, as in many similar cases, procured disaster.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span><a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Burgoyne’s
views on
the situation.</div>

<p>Burgoyne’s anxiety as to the future was expressed
in a private letter which he wrote to Germain on the
20th of August, accompanying the public dispatch of
the same date in which he reported the failure of the
Bennington expedition. He wrote that, in spite of
St. Leger’s victory, Fort Stanwix was holding out obstinately,
that no operation had been taken in his favour,
and that the American forces under Gates in his front
had been strengthened and now outnumbered his own.
Only one letter had reached him from Sir William Howe.
That letter was written from New York on the 17th of
July, and in it Howe stated that he had heard of Burgoyne’s
victory at Ticonderoga, adding ‘My intention is
for Pennsylvania, where I expect to meet Washington, but
if he goes to the northward contrary to my expectations
and you can keep him at bay, be assured I shall soon
be after him to relieve you’. As has been already stated,
no instructions from Germain had reached Howe on the
subject of Burgoyne and his army, though he had received
from Carleton a copy of Germain’s dispatch of March
26th, 1777, in which the programme of the expedition
from Canada had been detailed. Situated as Burgoyne
was, knowing that further advance would entail cutting
of his communications with Ticonderoga, it is no wonder
that in his letter to Germain he wrote that, had he latitude
in his orders, he would have thought it his duty to remain
where he was encamped opposite Saratoga, or further
back at Fort Edward where his communications would
be secure, until events in other quarters facilitated a
forward movement. But his instructions were ‘to force
a junction with Sir William Howe’, or at any rate to
make his way to Albany; and, as he sadly wrote, when
the catastrophe was over and he was a prisoner, ‘The
expedition I commanded was evidently meant at first
to be hazarded. Circumstances might require it should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
be devoted.’ A very strong man in his position would
have taken the responsibility of temporary retreat, but,
good soldier as he was, he was not a commanding character.
He knew the power which Germain possessed of making
and unmaking men, he had before his eyes the harsh
treatment of Carleton, because Carleton had exercised
wise discretion in falling back from Crown Point in the
preceding autumn. His instructions freed him from
responsibility if he went forward, the blame would be
his alone if he fell back. The evil influence of Germain
blighted loyal commanders and soldiers in America.
George the Third’s system was working itself out, and
the British Empire was being sacrificed to the ‘King’s
Friends’.</p>

<p>The first necessity was to bring up supplies from
Lake George for the further advance, enough to last
for twenty-five to thirty days, inasmuch as crossing the
Hudson and moving south meant the loss of communication
with Canada. This Burgoyne anticipated, and his
apprehensions proved true. Shortly after he crossed the <span class="sidenote">Burgoyne’s communications attacked by the colonists.</span>
Hudson and began his southward march, a force of
colonists, assembling at Skenesborough, on the 18th of
September attacked the British garrisons at Ticonderoga
and Mount Independence. They were repulsed after
four or five days’ fighting, but not until they had taken
outposts at the saw-mills, Mount Hope, and Sugar Hill,
captured three companies of British soldiers, and taken
or destroyed a large amount of stores and a number of
boats. Retreating up Lake George, they attacked a
detachment on an island in the lake named Diamond
Island and, though they were again beaten off, their
operations served the purpose of making Burgoyne’s
communications utterly insecure.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p>

<p>From the 16th of August to the 13th of September,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
the British army remained on the eastern bank of the
Hudson over against Saratoga. The reinforcements which
joined them apparently amounted to only 300 men.
News seems to have reached the army, before they moved
onward, that St. Leger was retreating from Fort Stanwix,
so that hope of co-operation in the direction of the
Mohawk river was at an end; on the other hand there
was a possibility that St. Leger’s men, brought down
the St. Lawrence and up Lake Champlain and Lake
George, might be able to join the main force. It is not
clear what was the exact number of men who crossed
the Hudson under Burgoyne’s command. According to
the evidence given at the subsequent Parliamentary
inquiry, the regulars, British and German, were rather
short of 5,000 men, but, if the Canadians and provincials
were included, the total fighting force must have reached
6,000. From Fort Edward to Albany is a distance of
over forty miles and to the confluence of the Mohawk
river about thirty-four; but Burgoyne was already
encamped ten miles south of Fort Edward and the
Americans, who had previously fallen back to what was <span class="sidenote">The Americans under Gates take up a position at Bemus’ Heights.</span>
known as the Half Moon at the mouth of the Mohawk
river, after the British defeat at Sancoick Mills and the
relief of Fort Stanwix, moved up the Hudson a little way
above Stillwater, and took up a strong position on high
ground called Bemus’ Heights, where they were within
ten miles’ distance of the point where Burgoyne crossed
the river.</p>

<p>General Philip Schuyler had been in command of the
Congress troops on the side of Canada. He was a man
of the highest character, and apparently a perfectly
competent soldier, whose Fabian tactics were beginning
to achieve success when he was superseded. After the
abandonment of Ticonderoga and the rout which followed,
the tide of public opinion set against him—without any
adequate reason. The New Englanders were jealous of
a general from New York state; and, under a resolution
of Congress, Schuyler was in the middle of August replaced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
by Horatio Gates, a godson of Horace Walpole, who, like
Richard Montgomery, had been born in the United
Kingdom and had served in the British army, having
been badly wounded in Braddock’s disastrous expedition.
Gates, who in the previous year had commanded the
garrison at Ticonderoga, was a self-seeking, intriguing
man. His subsequent disloyalty to Washington, and his
defeat at Camden, clouded what reputation he gained
through receiving Burgoyne’s surrender. When he took
over the command of the troops opposing Burgoyne, his
task was comparatively easy. He had good men with
him, among others Arnold, who had returned from the
march to relieve Fort Stanwix and between whom and
Gates there was no love lost, he had also Daniel Morgan
and Lincoln; while the army under their command had
received an accession to its numbers in consequence of
Howe having moved off from New York to Philadelphia.
The Americans now largely outnumbered Burgoyne’s
force, and behind them, lower down the Hudson, the
Highlands were held against a possible movement on the
part of Clinton, who commanded the troops left behind
at New York when Howe sailed for Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Burgoyne
crosses
the
Hudson
and
advances
South.</div>

<p>About six miles below Fort Edward, between that
fort and the Batten Kill stream, at a place named Fort
Miller, there were rapids in the Hudson, where a portage
was necessary for the boats descending the river; below
it navigation was unimpeded, and the stores and baggage
of the army could be carried by water. A bridge of
boats was thrown over the river about half a mile above
the Batten Kill, and by this bridge the whole army
crossed the Hudson on the 13th and 14th of September
from the eastern to the western shore. Burgoyne was
subsequently criticized for crossing, but the criticism had
no sound foundation. If he was to reach Albany at all,
he must cross the river at some point or other, and the
further he went down stream the more difficult the
crossing was likely to be. Moreover the high road ran
along the western bank, while on the opposite shore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
swamp and mountain would have made it impossible at
certain points to march close to the river bank, and the
army would therefore have been separated from the
boats. On the western side of the Hudson the country,
through which the troops advanced, was wooded and
broken, the road and bridges over the intervening creeks
had been cut up by the enemy, and progress was slow;
but by the 17th less than four miles intervened between
the two armies. On the 18th there was skirmishing,
while the British force were repairing bridges and cutting
a way through the bush: and on the 19th a general
action took place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Action of
September
19.</div>

<p>The British army advanced in three divisions. On
the right under General Fraser were the 24th Regiment,
the light infantry and the grenadiers, accompanied by
Indian and Canadian scouts and supported by some
German troops under Colonel Breyman. The centre
column, entirely composed of British regiments, was
under Burgoyne’s immediate command. The left wing
was in charge of Riedesel, and included the main body
of the German soldiers with most of the artillery. The
left marched along the high road on the lowland following
the course of the river, and one British regiment, the
47th, on the bank of the river, guarded the boats which
carried the stores. There was a deep ravine between
the armies, and Fraser’s division made a wide circuit
to the right in order to keep on the high ground. The
movement was successfully carried out, and Fraser
established himself in a strong position while the centre
column moved forward, crossed the ravine, formed on
the other side, and bearing to the right became engaged
with the enemy. The centre of the battle was a clearing
in the woods, where there was a homestead known as
Freeman’s farm; from this farm the Americans had
molested Burgoyne’s advance, and being dislodged by
artillery fell back into the cover behind. Their intention
had been to turn the British right, but, finding that
Fraser was too strongly posted, they counter-marched and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
placed their full force in front of the centre column.
Here the battle was fought, and for four hours, from
three o’clock in the afternoon till seven, the brunt of the
fighting fell upon three British regiments, the 20th, the
21st and the 62nd, a fourth regiment, the 9th, being held
in reserve. Some help came from Fraser’s men, but
the safety of the army depended upon his holding his
ground on the right, so that he could not bring up his
whole division in support of the centre. Constantly
reinforced and covered by the woods, the Americans, led
by Arnold, who commanded the left wing of their army,
pressed hard upon the fighting regiments, until, late in
the day, Riedesel, having pushed forward his troops
along the line of the river, wheeled them sharp to the right
and struck in on the flank. This decided the battle, and,
as darkness fell, the forces of the Congress drew off,
leaving Burgoyne’s army in possession of the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Result of
the fight—Burgoyne’s
losses.</div>

<p>The fight was won, but, as Burgoyne wrote in his
subsequent dispatch, ‘it was soon found that no fruits,
honour excepted, were attained by the preceding victory.’
He had lost about 500 men, the 62nd Regiment having
especially suffered, and though the losses of the Americans
had possibly been heavier, reinforcements were available
for them and their position grew stronger and stronger.
On the day after the battle the English moved forward
slightly until they were almost within cannon shot of
their enemies, at a distance of about half a mile, and
in turn threw up entrenchments. On the 21st Burgoyne
received a message from Clinton, dated the 12th, to the <span class="sidenote">Message from Clinton.</span>
effect that in about ten days’ time he intended to move
up the Hudson and attack the American forts in the
Highlands. Burgoyne sent back word, urging the necessity
of some such operation in his favour in order to
divert part of the American force which was barring his
way, and he stated that he would hold his ground if
possible, till the 12th of October. The days went on: <span class="sidenote">Scarcity of provisions.</span>
provisions began to run short: on the 3rd of October it
was found necessary to reduce the soldiers’ rations:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
and, some movement having become inevitable, Burgoyne <span class="sidenote">Further movement necessary.</span>
determined on the 7th to make a reconnaissance on the
enemy’s left—the side furthest removed from the Hudson,
in order definitely to ascertain whether there was a
possibility of either forcing a passage or at any rate so
far dislodging the enemy as to enable the British army
to retreat unmolested. At the same time it was hoped
that under cover of the reconnaissance, forage, badly
needed, might be collected for the horses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Action of
October
7.</div>

<p>Only about 1,500 regular soldiers were available for
the movement, with ten pieces of artillery: and, small
as the number was, hardly enough men were left behind
to guard the lines. The detachment advanced, and
was formed within about three-quarters of a mile of the
enemy’s left, waiting for some of the marksmen with
Canadians and Indians to make a detour through the
woods still further to the right and take the enemy in
the rear. On a sudden the Americans in superior numbers
made a determined attack on the left wing of the little
force, where were the grenadiers and a German regiment.
At the same time the flank of the right wing was in
imminent danger of being turned: and, while the troops
on this side were being drawn back and reformed in order
to secure the retreat, the Americans redoubled the
attack on the grenadiers and the Germans. The German
regiment gave way, the grenadiers were overpowered,
and complete disaster was averted only by the stanch
fighting of the gunners and by bringing up supports <span class="sidenote">The English heavily defeated and their corps partly taken.</span>
from the right under General Fraser who, in carrying
out the movement, was mortally wounded. Hard pressed
and heavily defeated, leaving six guns behind them, the
force regained their lines, but the Americans, who fought
with conspicuous boldness and resolution, followed on,
broke through the entrenchments, and eventually stormed
the post in the rear of the right which was held by Colonel
Breyman and the scanty German reserve. The position
was taken, but night came on, Arnold who had led the fight
was wounded, and the Congress troops drew off, content<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
with the success which they had already gained. Under
cover of the same night Burgoyne fell back, and took up
a new position on high ground in the rear of his former
camp.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Up to this point in the campaign General Burgoyne
may have made mistakes, but at any rate he had not
shown himself to be either irresolute or incompetent.
He had been sent to achieve the impossible: he had
loyally attempted to carry out his instructions, even
when opposed to his own views; and, bearing in mind
the small number of his troops and the difficulty of securing
provisions and supplies, it is not easy to find ground <span class="sidenote">Burgoyne’s fatal delay.</span>
for criticism either in his delays or in his fighting. But
now his duty was clear, to retreat at once on Fort Edward
and save the remnant of the expedition. Every hour
was of importance, for every hour numbers greater than
his own, emboldened by success, were gathering round him
and threatening his retreat. The position in which he
was placed after the battle of the 7th of October was no
doubt one of great difficulty, but at any rate there was
only one practical course to be taken, and a firm resolute
man, intent only on the public good, would have taken
it at once. Burgoyne acted otherwise, his movements
were leisurely and almost invited the final catastrophe.
Reading the account of what took place, and his own
defence, it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the
personal element was strong in him, that there was
a theatrical strain in his character, and that he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
concerned with public opinion and effect, instead of
simply gripping the nettle in manful fashion, neglecting
no chance, and fighting out hard to the last.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

<p>All day on the 8th the army remained in their new
position offering battle, and burying General Fraser
with the honour due to a brave and much loved man,
while parties of the enemy crossed the Hudson, and fired
on the British camp from the opposite side. A day <span class="sidenote">Beginning of the retreat.</span>
was lost, the Americans were beginning to turn the right
or inland flank, and on the night of the 8th the retreat
began, the wounded being left behind in hospital. The
weather was bad, the baggage encumbered the army, it
was necessary to guard the boats on the river, yet the
distance to be traversed to Fort Edward was less than
twenty miles and a hurried retreat would have saved
the army. When the morning of the 9th came, however,
Burgoyne called a halt for his wearied men, and through
the greater part of that day no further movement was
made. Late in the afternoon the march was resumed,
when darkness came, the troops passed through Saratoga
and crossed the Fish Kill stream, and on the morning
of the 10th the artillery was brought over. Meanwhile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
the Americans had pressed forward up the eastern bank
of the Hudson, and, when the British troops neared
Saratoga, they found a party of the enemy already in
front of them on the western side, who were beginning to
throw up entrenchments, but withdrew as the British
came up, leaving the road still open for retreat. On
the 10th some troops were sent forward by Burgoyne
to hold the ford opposite Fort Edward and to cover the
work of repairing the bridges, but were recalled when
the main American force attacked the rear of the British
army on the line of the Fish Kill. The boats could now <span class="sidenote">Loss of the boats.</span>
no longer be adequately defended against the American
guns, the provisions were taken out of them, and they <span class="sidenote">Burgoyne’s irresolution.</span>
drifted into the enemy’s hands. Through the next three
days, the 11th, the 12th and the 13th, Burgoyne remained
inactive. Councils of war were held, and it was contemplated
to make a night march and try to cross the
river near Fort Edward, but the procrastination and
indecision of the general put off the movement until it
was too late. ‘The army’, wrote Burgoyne in his subsequent
dispatch, ‘took the best position possible and
fortified, waiting till the 13th at night, in the anxious
hope of succours from our friends or, the next desirable
expectation, an attack from our enemy’. On the 14th <span class="sidenote">Negotiations with Gates.</span>
negotiations were begun with General Gates, they continued
for three days, terms were signed late on the 16th,
and on the 17th the English surrendered to the American <span class="sidenote">The final surrender.</span>
general and his army, kindly and generous in the hour
of victory as they had been strong and stubborn in
fighting.</p>

<p>The delay in the conclusion of the matter was due at
first to the wording of the terms which Gates dictated,
and subsequently to intelligence which reached both <span class="sidenote">Clinton’s movements.</span>
armies of Clinton’s movements up the Hudson. On the
4th of October Clinton started up the river from New
York with some ships of war, carrying 3,000 men, and
on the 6th stormed two American forts which barred
the passage of the river about fifty miles from the sea;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
some of the ships went higher up stream but did not
come within many miles of Albany; and, brilliant as
the operation was, it could not in any case have affected
the main issue and only served, with the help of rumour
and report, to make Gates anxious to conclude the negotiations
of surrender and Burgoyne for a few hours reluctant
to sign the terms. At length the inevitable was
accepted and the remains of the English army, under
5,000 in number, of whom about 3,500 were fighting
men, were taken as prisoners of war to Albany and
Boston.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Causes
of the
disaster.</div>

<p>The ultimate cause of the disaster was Lord George
Germain. Here is Carleton’s judgement upon the matter,
contained in a letter to Burgoyne dated the following <span class="sidenote">Carleton on Lord George Germain.</span>
12th of November, ‘This unfortunate event, it is to be
hoped, will in future prevent ministers from pretending
to direct operations of war, in a country at 3,000 miles
distance, of which they have so little knowledge as not
to be able to distinguish between good, bad, or interested
advices, or to give positive orders in matters which from
their nature are ever upon the change.’ The more <span class="sidenote">Character of Burgoyne.</span>
immediate cause was the character of Burgoyne. His
condemnation is written in his own dispatch.</p>

<p>‘The bulk of the enemy’s army was hourly joined by
new corps of militia and volunteers, and their numbers
together amounted to upwards of 16,000 men. After
the execution of the treaty General Gates drew together
the force that had surrounded my position, and I had
the consolation to have as many witnesses as I had men
under my command, of its amounting to the numbers
mentioned above.’</p>

<p>Why had the 16,000 men gathered round him? Because<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
he had given them time to do so, because in the hour of
need his thought was rather of saving his own reputation
than of saving the force under his command. Would
Wolfe, weakly and suffering, have waited helplessly for
something to turn up, looking for co-operation from
Amherst in the far distance, as Burgoyne looked for it
from Clinton? Would he have found consolation in
allowing the enemy’s numbers to grow and counting up
how far superior they were to his own? Would he have
been at pains to make the story plausible and dramatic,
so that he might hold up his head thereafter in London
circles and retain the favour of those who were in high
places? It was not English to court surrender, and
to cast about for excuse for surrender. Had Chatham
been in Germain’s place, no such foolhardy expedition
would have been ordered cut and dried from England.
Had Wolfe been in Burgoyne’s, if success was possible
he would have achieved it, if it was impossible he
would have redeemed failure or died. Military skill,
daring, manhood, self-reliance, leadership of soldiers and
of men, were the qualities which less than twenty years
before had shone out in dark days round Quebec; the
same qualities seemed dead or numbed, when Burgoyne
bade his men lay down their arms by the banks of the
Hudson river.</p>

<p>The story of this ill-fated expedition has been told at
some length because it is part and parcel of the history
of Canada. The scene of the later years of the War of
Independence was the Atlantic seaboard; and Canada,
except on her western borders, though threatened, was
unmolested. The surrender of Burgoyne’s army by no
means finished the fighting, the English were still to win <span class="sidenote">Consequences of the disaster.</span>
barren successes before the final catastrophe at Yorktown;
but after Saratoga the war entered upon a wholly new
stage. The surrender in itself was serious enough. No
colonists had in modern history achieved so great a
triumph, no such disaster had ever clouded British arms
in the story of her colonization. The Preface of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
<i>Annual Register</i> for 1777 refers to the ‘awful aspect of
the times’, awful indeed to a country whose best men
had no faith in her cause. But the great practical result
which followed on the reverse of Saratoga, the result
which eventually decided the war, was that the French <span class="sidenote">The French intervene in the war.</span>
now joined hands with the Americans, and the latter
thereby secured the help of a fleet, strong enough, when
the Spaniards at a later date also entered the ranks of
England’s enemies, to compete with the British navy on
the western seas.</p>

<p>While, however, the intervention of France greatly
increased the difficulties with which Great Britain had to
contend at this critical time of her history, for the moment
it made the war more popular in England, inasmuch as
Englishmen were now called upon to fight against their <span class="sidenote">The French alliance with the Americans tended to protect Canada from invasion.</span>
old rivals and not merely against their kinsfolk. In
another respect too it was of distinct advantage to the
British Empire, in that it brought to Canada immunity
from invasion. The American colonists welcomed French
aid in securing their independence, but they had no mind
to restore Canada to France, and they looked with
suspicion on any proposal or utterance which might
seem to point in that direction. Though the French in
their treaty with the United States disclaimed any intention
of national aggrandizement in America,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Admiral
D’Estaing, in October, 1778, a few months after his
arrival in American waters, issued a proclamation to the
Canadians, appealing to their French nationality; and
Lafayette proposed a scheme for an invasion of Canada
which Congress accepted but Washington set aside.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
There was sufficient uneasiness in American minds with
regard to French designs to restrict French co-operation
in the main to the Atlantic side; and, though the
Canadians were excited by their countrymen’s appeal,
they did not rise in arms themselves, nor did the Americans
attempt to repeat the movement by which Montgomery
had over-run the country up to the walls of Quebec.</p>

<p>It would not indeed have been easy for them to do so,
for Carleton and his successor Haldimand, though badly
in need of reinforcements, were yet better prepared and
had more men at their command than when the war
first broke out. Immediately after Burgoyne’s capitulation <span class="sidenote">Precautions taken in Canada against invasion.</span>
Ticonderoga and Crown Point were abandoned, and
the troops were withdrawn to the northern end of Lake
Champlain. A year later Haldimand directed the whole
country round the lake to be cleared of settlement and
cultivation, as a safeguard against American invasion.
At various points, where such invasion might take place,
he established posts, on an island at the opening of Lake
Ontario, which was named Carleton Island; at the
Isle aux Noix at the head of the Richelieu river, and at
Sorel at its mouth: on the river St. Francis which joins
the St. Lawrence below Sorel, flowing from the direction
of Vermont: and on the Chaudière river over against
Quebec, lest Arnold’s inroad by the line of that river
should be repeated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Border
War.</div>

<p>Nor was this all. As in Count Frontenac’s time, and
with much the same ruthlessness as in those earlier days,
Canada was defended by counter attacks upon the border
settlements of the revolting colonies, Loyalists and Indians
dealing the blows and bearing the penalties. In May
and June of 1778, Brant harried the New York frontier
and burnt the town of Springfield; in July, in order,
it was said, to counteract American designs against
Niagara, Colonel John Butler, with a force of Rangers
and Indians, carried war far into the enemy’s country
and uprooted the settlements at Wyoming, on the eastern
branch of the Susquehanna river within the borders of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
Pennsylvania. Fact and fiction have combined to keep
alive the memories of the massacre at Wyoming; and,
together with the even more terrible tragedy of Cherry
Valley which followed, it stands to the discredit of
England in the story of these most barbarous border
wars.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> In September the Mohawk leader burnt to the
ground the houses and barns at the German Flatts,
though the settlers had been warned in time to take
refuge in Fort Dayton. In November Brant joined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
forces with Walter Butler, son of the raider of Wyoming;
and together they carried death and desolation into the
Cherry Valley settlement in Tryon county. In the
following year the Americans took a terrible revenge
for these doings, and a strong force under General John
Sullivan turned the country of the Six Nation Indians
into a wilderness. ‘General Sullivan,’ wrote Washington
to Lafayette, ‘has completed the entire destruction of
the country of the Six Nations, driven all the inhabitants,
men, women, and children out of it’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">George
Rogers
Clark in
the West.</div>

<p>Further west, in 1778 and 1779, the Illinois region
and the settlements on the middle Mississippi fell into
American hands, never to be regained, the leader of the
backwoodsmen in this quarter being George Rogers
Clark, a young Virginian, one of the pioneers of settlement
in Kentucky, a most able leader and a hard determined
man. In July, 1778, Clark surprised and took
the fort and settlement of Kaskaskia standing on the
river of that name a little above its junction with the
Mississippi, and immediately afterwards he received the
submission of the post at Vincennes on the Wabash river.
A few months later, in December, 1778, Vincennes was
re-occupied by Hamilton, Lieutenant-Governor of Detroit,
with a handful of men. Before the following February
ended, Hamilton was in turn attacked and overpowered
by Clark who carried out a daring winter march; and,
being forced to surrender at discretion, the English
commander was, according to English accounts, treated
through long months of imprisonment with unmerited
harshness. The truth was that, as the war went on,
bitterness increased, and when, as in the West and on
the border the combatants were backwoodsmen, Rangers
and Indians, the fighting became a series of ruthless
reprisals.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Later
raids
from
Canada.</div>

<p>Later again, in 1780 and 1781, parties sent out from
Canada retraced the routes taken by Burgoyne and
St. Leger, harried the country at the southern end of
Lakes George and Champlain, and laid waste the settlements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
in the Mohawk valley. In one, commanded by
Major Carleton, brother of the late governor of Canada,
Fort Anne and Fort George were taken with their
garrisons; in another, on the line of the Mohawk, Major
Ross, advancing from Oswego, inflicted heavy loss on
the Americans. In all these expeditions on either side
there was the same object, to prevent invasion by counter
invasion, to destroy stores, and to terrorize the adherents
of the enemy; but none of them, except the exploits
of Clark, contributed materially to the issue of the war.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fighting
on the
Penobscot.</div>

<p>On or near the Atlantic coast-line of Canada, in 1779,
fighting took place which might well have had lasting
results. An expedition was sent in that year from
Halifax to the Penobscot river, commanded by Maclean,
who had done good service under Carleton at the time
of the American invasion. In June he established himself
at Castine at the mouth of the Penobscot; and, inasmuch
as the place was then within the borders of
Massachusetts, he was towards the end of July attacked
by a small squadron and a force of militia sent from
and paid for by that state. For between two or three
weeks the Americans besieged the British post until,
towards the end of the second week in August, British
ships under Sir George Collier appeared on the scene,
and all the American vessels were taken or destroyed.
Maclean’s expedition was repeated with equal success by
Sir John Sherbrooke in the war of 1812, but neither
enterprise produced the permanent result of making the
Penobscot river, as it should have been, the boundary
between Canada and the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Carleton
succeeded
by
Haldimand.</div>

<p>It has been seen that in June, 1777, Carleton sent in
his resignation of the governorship of Canada. Burgoyne
wrote privately to Germain at the end of July, before he
started on his expedition, to decline the appointment in
case it should be offered to him; and in August, 1777,
General Haldimand, who was then at home in Switzerland,
was nominated as Carleton’s successor. He was
ordered to go out as soon as possible in a ship which, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
Germain wrote to Carleton on the 19th of October, was
to bring the latter home, but did not leave England till
the end of April or beginning of May following, arriving
at Quebec at the end of June, 1778. Carleton then
immediately returned to England, and was received with
honour by the King to the disgust of Lord George
Germain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Haldimand’s
government.</div>

<p>General Haldimand, Sir Frederick Haldimand as he
afterwards was, governed Canada till the end of 1784,
and he governed it, in thankless times, strongly and well.
In the year 1778 he was sixty years of age, having been
born in 1718. Like his great friend Henry Bouquet, he
was a Swiss. His birthplace was Yverdon at the south-western
end of the lake of Neuchâtel, and there he died
in 1791, the year in which the Canada Act was passed.
There is a tablet to his memory in Henry VII’s Chapel
in Westminster Abbey. His career was that of a soldier
of fortune. With Bouquet, he served the Stadtholder of
the Netherlands in a regiment of Swiss Guards; and in
1754<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> the two officers entered the British service as
lieutenant-colonels of the newly-raised regiment of
Royal Americans. He fought under Abercromby at
Ticonderoga, and afterwards served under Amherst;
and in 1759, while rebuilding the fort at Oswego, he beat
off a force of Canadians and Indians commanded by
St. Luc de la Corne, who in later days was a member
of his Legislative Council at Quebec. After the capitulation
of Montreal, being a French-speaking officer, he was
selected by Amherst to take possession of the city. He
subsequently acted as governor of Three Rivers, and
when to his great grief Bouquet died at Pensacola in 1765,
Haldimand, in 1767, succeeded his friend in the command<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
in Florida. In 1773 he went to New York to act for
General Gage while the latter was on leave in England.
In 1775 he was brought back to England, and in 1778
he went out to govern Canada.</p>

<p>Haldimand was a man of the Carleton type; and,
before he left London to take up his appointment, he
wrote to Germain to the effect that he should be given
full discretion in military matters, and, as civil governor,
have the nomination to all appointments. Like Carleton,
he was attacked by the partisans of Congress in Canada
as a military despot, the enemy of civil liberties, the
best known case against him being that of Du Calvet,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
a French Protestant, who was in 1780 arrested and
imprisoned for encouraging and abetting treason, and
who subsequently published his case against the governor
in London. That Du Calvet was a traitor there seems
to have been no doubt, but his charges against the
governor coloured the view which was commonly taken
in after years of Haldimand’s administration. None the
less, whatever may have been the technical merits of this
and other individual cases, it is beyond question that,
at a time when England was badly served both at home
and abroad, in the most critical years, and in Canada
where the position was most difficult, she was conspicuously
well served by Carleton and Haldimand.
Haldimand governed a community, in which the minority,
as in Carleton’s time, was largely disaffected, and the
loyalty of the majority was undermined by French
appeals. From day to day the danger of attack at this
point or at that was imminent, while there was constant
risk that the supplies which came over the sea would be
intercepted by French ships or American privateers.
In England Haldimand’s master was still the same self-willed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
half-informed minister Germain. In Canada there
were few that he could trust. Yet solitary in public as
in private life—for he had no wife or child—he held the
reins of government with a firm and an honest hand,
a good servant of England though of foreign birth. If
Canada at the present day be compared with the province
of Quebec which the Peace of 1763 gave into British
keeping, the three main elements in the evolution of the
great Dominion will be found to have been British immigration,
canals, and railways. Railways, opening the
North-West and linking the two oceans, date from long
after Haldimand’s time; but he was governor when the
first steps were taken to improve the waterways of
Canada, and he watched over the incoming of the United
Empire Loyalists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Vermont
negotiations.</div>

<p>Not the least of Haldimand’s difficulties was that he
had to negotiate peace and wage war at the same time,
for, while directing or controlling border raids at other
points on the Canadian frontier, he had on his hands,
from 1779 onwards, troublesome and in the end abortive
negotiations with the settlers in the present state of
Vermont. Of the character of these settlers he seems
to have had but a poor opinion, their lawless antecedents
no doubt not being to his mind. Ethan Allen and the
Green Mountain Boys had not been animated by American
patriotism alone when at the beginning of the war they
took Ticonderoga. They had in their minds to put
themselves in evidence and to vindicate their claim to
be free of New York. While the war went on, and after
it ended, their determination to be an independent state
was as strong as ever; and their negotiations with
Canada were an intimation to Congress that the price of
their continued adhesion to the continental cause must
be recognition of their local independence. The policy
had the immediate merit of giving them a respite from
Canadian raids, and it left open a choice of future issues.
The Vermont men knew the value or the weakness of
their geographical position as regards Canada. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
patent then as it was in the later war of 1812. In a
private letter to Lord North, dated the 24th of October,
1783,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> Haldimand wrote, ‘Since the provisional treaty
has been made public, several persons of influence in the
state of Vermont have been here at different times,
they all agree in describing these people as very averse
to Congress and its measures.... They made no scruple
of telling me that Vermont must either be annexed to
Canada or become mistress of it, as it is the only channel
by which the produce of their country can be conveyed
to a market, but they assured me that they rather wished
the former.’ The Vermont settlers were, in short, like
many states and many individuals before and since,
on the fence; but in the end they were neither annexed
to Canada nor did they become mistress of her, for in 1791
Vermont became a state of the American Union, and
Canada worked out her own salvation.</p>

<p>Haldimand’s dispatches might have been written by
Carleton. There is the same point of view, almost the
same turn of expression. On the 25th of October, 1780,
in a long dispatch to Lord George Germain, giving an
account of the general conditions of men and things in
Canada, he wrote, ‘As it is my duty, it has been my
business to inform myself of the state of the country,
and I coincide with the majority of the Legislative
Council in considering the Canadians as the people of
the country, and think that in making laws and regulations
for the administration of these laws, regard is to
be paid to the sentiments and manner of thinking of
60,000 rather than of 2,000—three-fourths of whom are
traders and cannot with propriety be considered as
residents of the province. In this point of view the
Quebec Act was both just and politic, though unfortunately
for the British Empire it was enacted ten years
too late. It requires but little penetration to discover
that, had the system of government solicited by the old
subjects been adopted in Canada, this colony would in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
1775 have become one of the United States of America.’<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
Three years later, when the war was over, in his letter
to Lord North referred to above, he wrote ‘This province
can only be preserved by bringing back the Canadians
to a regular subordination, and by rendering them useful
as a well-disciplined militia. In order to effectuate
this, the authority of government must be strengthened
and not diminished’.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Like Carleton and like Murray, Haldimand had it at
heart to provide the people of Canada with an upright
and kindly administration. Among the various grievances,
real or alleged, which were ventilated from time
to time, one of the most substantial, so far as the French
Canadians were concerned, was the excessive amount
which was exacted from them by officials and lawyers
in the form of fees of office. In 1780 Haldimand assented
to an ordinance regulating the fees for two years, at
the expiration of which time he hoped that the Legislature
would, from the experience gained in the meantime,
be able to draw up ‘a more perfect list of fees, more
permanent and less burthensome to the people’ for, he
wrote, ‘the fees in general are by far too high and more
than the people of this province can bear.’<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> A favourite
complaint of the British minority, who had as little to
complain of as they were loud and persistent in complaining,
was that there was no statutory provision for
the right of Habeas Corpus, which was supposed to have
been abolished by the Quebec Act. When peace was
restored and the step could safely be taken, Haldimand met
this grievance by passing, in 1784, an ordinance ‘for
securing the liberty of the subject and for the prevention
of imprisonments out of this province’.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> When reporting
the passing of the fees ordinance Haldimand wrote, ‘Sir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
Guy Carleton had in the sessions 1775 proposed to
regulate the fees of office, and had that business very
much at heart. Committees were appointed for that
salutory purpose and, though many obstacles were
thrown in the way, great progress was made. The
ordinance was lost for that time by Sir Guy Carleton’s
putting an end to the session in consequence of motions
made in council by Mr. Livius and others’.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> He himself
suffered from similar obstruction; his dispatch goes
on to refer to members of his council, ‘who, however
willing they may be to circumscribe the King’s authority
in measures of general utility to his service and the
welfare of his people, are for carrying on to the greatest
height his prerogative to grant Letters Patent for the
emolument of individuals though to the oppression of
the people’. As the outcome of the Livius case, two
additional Royal Instructions had been issued to Haldimand,
dated the 29th of March, 1779. The first prohibited
him from interpreting the words in the general instructions
‘It is our further Will and Pleasure that any five of
the said council shall constitute a board of council
for transacting all business in which their advice and
consent may be requisite, acts of legislation only excepted’,
as Carleton had interpreted them, namely, as authorizing
the governor to select five particular members of the
Legislative Council to form an Executive or Privy Council;
and it instructed him to communicate this decision to
the council. The second instructed him to communicate
to the council ‘such and so many of our said instructions,
wherein their advice and consent are made requisite,
with such others from time to time as you shall judge
for our service to be imparted to them’.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Haldimand
did not at once communicate these additional instructions
to his council. He thought that at the time it was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
for the public interest to do so, and he wrote to Germain
to that effect, but only brought upon himself a severe
reprimand alike from Germain and from the Board of
Trade. Equally he thought it inadvisable, under existing
circumstances, to communicate to his council certain
clauses in the general instructions, in which the Home
Government practically invited the Quebec Legislative
Council to modify the Quebec Act, recommending the
introduction to some extent of English civil law and also
statutory provision for Habeas Corpus. Like Carleton he
saw things face to face, as a soldier not as a constitutional
lawyer, and he gave advice according to existing conditions,
which were those of war and not of peace. These two
governors may have been technically wrong in this point or
in that, but they had the root of the matter in them, they
governed with a single eye, a firm hand, and with most
generous and humane intent. ‘Party spirit,’ Haldimand
wrote to Germain, ‘is the enemy of every private as well
as public virtue. Since my arrival in the province I have
steered clear of all parties and have taken great care
not to enter into the resentments of my predecessor or
his friends, but this present occasion obliges me to declare
to your lordship that in general Mr. Livius’ conduct has
not impressed people with a favourable idea of his moderation.’<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
There was no party spirit about Carleton,
nor yet about Haldimand. In a bad time, when partisanship
was rife, they stood for the good name of England,
and for the substance of sound and honest administration.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Clinton
succeeds
Howe at
Philadelphia
and
retreats
to New
York.</div>

<p>At the same time that Haldimand relieved Carleton,
Sir Henry Clinton took over from Howe the command
of the army at Philadelphia. He arrived there at the
beginning of May, 1778, and at the end of the month
Howe left for England. The abandonment of Philadelphia
had been ordered from home, in view of the new
complications produced by the intervention of France
in the war. All the available ships carried off to New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
York, stores, baggage, and numbers of Loyalists, while
Clinton retreated with his army overland through New
Jersey. On the 18th of June he left Philadelphia, which
was immediately re-occupied by the Americans, and for
a fortnight, closely followed by Washington, he slowly
made his way in the heat of the summer through the
enemy’s country. On the 28th of June in what is known
as the battle of Monmouth, near Freehold Court House,
he fought a rearguard action with Lee, who commanded
the advance of Washington’s army: and, thereby covering
his retreat, reached Sandy Hook, and on the 5th of July
carried over his troops to New York.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
French
fleet.</div>

<p>D’Estaing and a French squadron had now appeared
on the scene, threatened New York, and in co-operation
with the American general Sullivan attacked the English
in Rhode Island. Bad weather, the skill and seamanship
of Admiral Howe, and the preparations made by the
English commander on shore, rendered the expedition
abortive, and the summer closed without decisive success
on either side.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Operations
in
the south.</div>

<p>Later in the year, an expedition under Colonel Campbell,
was dispatched to the south, and landing at the end of
December near Savannah, the capital of the colony of <span class="sidenote">Savannah taken by the English.</span>
Georgia, by a skilful movement took the town and
captured the whole of the garrison and stores. General
Prevost, who arrived from Florida shortly afterwards
and took over command of the British troops in Georgia,
advanced into South Carolina and, in May, 1779, threatened
Charleston, but was compelled to retreat. In September
D’Estaing’s fleet appeared before Savannah; on the
9th of October a combined French and American force
attempted to re-take the town, but were beaten off with
heavy loss: and in the spring of 1780 Clinton arrived with <span class="sidenote">Clinton takes command in the south.</span>
a large body of troops from New York to direct operations
in the southern states. A year and a half had passed
since he had brought off his army from Philadelphia,
and little had been done. There had been fighting on
the Hudson, the coasts of Virginia and the New England<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
colonies had been harried, small towns had been sacked
and burnt, and stores and ships destroyed, causing
damage and distress to the Americans but also unwisely
embittering the war. Now the English garrison at
Rhode Island had been withdrawn and, while New
York was still strongly held, the main efforts on the
British side were directed to re-conquering the southern
states, where Loyalist sympathies were strong and
widely spread.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Taking of
Charleston.</div>

<p>Charleston was the main point of attack. It was
bravely defended for several weeks by General Lincoln,
but his communications were cut by Clinton’s stronger
force, the investment was gradually completed, and on
the 12th of May, 1780, the town was surrendered and
the garrison became prisoners of war. This success was
followed by the annihilation of another small body of
American troops, on which occasion Tarleton, the British
commander, was accused of indiscriminate slaughter.
Clinton having returned to New York, the command in <span class="sidenote">Cornwallis.</span>
the south devolved on Cornwallis, whose campaigns in
1780 and 1781 were the closing scenes of the war. He
began with a great success. General Gates had been sent
south to take command of the American forces in the
Carolinas, and, having collected an army which largely
outnumbered the troops at the disposal of Cornwallis, <span class="sidenote">The battle of Camden.</span>
marched to attack the latter at Camden to the north-west
of Charleston. Cornwallis resolved on a counter attack;
and, after a night march on either side, the two forces
came into collision near Camden at dawn on the 16th
of August. After hard fighting the Americans gave
way before a British bayonet charge and a rout
ensued, which was supplemented by a further small
victory gained by Tarleton over the American general
Sumter, who had previously intercepted Cornwallis’
communications and captured a convoy and some
prisoners. Cornwallis now advanced into North Carolina,
but behind him the backwoodsmen gathered, and on the
7th of October overwhelmed, after heavy fighting, a strong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
detachment of Loyalists under Major Ferguson at a place
called King’s Mountain. This reverse had the same <span class="sidenote">King’s Mountain.</span>
effect as the fights at Trenton or Bennington. Cornwallis
had to fall back, the American cause revived in the
south, and the extraordinary difficulty of dealing with
guerilla warfare in an immense territory was once more
effectively illustrated. In December Gates was superseded
by an abler and more trustworthy general, Nathaniel
Greene.</p>

<p>In the north no decisive action took place during
the year. The English made an incursion into New
Jersey, without producing any effect. A French fleet and
army under de Rochambeau arrived at Rhode Island,
where Clinton would have attacked them in force but
for want of co-operation on the part of the English
admiral Arbuthnot. The American cause received a heavy
blow in the treachery of Arnold, and on the other hand,
before the close of the year, the Dutch were added to
the long list of enemies against whom England was
maintaining an unequal struggle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The campaign
of 1781,
Cornwallis
moves
north.</div>

<p>With the opening of the new year, 1781, Cornwallis
moved northwards. In the middle of January the light
troops from his force, who were under Tarleton’s command,
were heavily defeated by the American general Morgan,
at Cowpens near the border line between South and North
Carolina. Having received reinforcements, Cornwallis <span class="sidenote">Cowpens.</span>
still advanced, Greene falling back before him until he
had collected a larger number of men than the English
general had at his disposal. The two forces met near
Guilford Court House on the 15th of March, under much <span class="sidenote">Guilford Court House.</span>
the same conditions as had preceded the fight at Camden;
and after an even fight the English were victorious, though
with a loss of about one-third of their small army. After
the battle, Cornwallis fell back for a while towards
Wilmington, and, as the Americans were again active
behind him in South Carolina, debated whether to
continue his efforts to stamp out resistance in the south,
or to march forward into Virginia where there was now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
a strong British force, commanded at first by Arnold and <span class="sidenote">Cornwallis in Virginia.</span>
afterwards by Burgoyne’s colleague General Phillips, who
were opposed by Lafayette. He determined on the
northward movement and effected a junction with
Phillips’ troops, their commander having in the meantime
died at Petersburg in Virginia late in May.</p>

<p>The fighting went on in the Carolinas with varying
success. On the 25th of April Lord Rawdon, who was
then in command, defeated Greene at Hobkirk’s Hill.
In September his successor Colonel Stuart fought a drawn
battle at Eutaw Springs, but the Americans secured one
point and another, and the balance of the campaign
was against the British cause. In Virginia Cornwallis
and Lafayette manœuvred against each other, the British
operations being hampered by the apprehension of a
combined attack in force by the French and Americans
on New York, which led Clinton to order the return of
a part of the army in Virginia. The order was countermanded,
but Cornwallis was instructed to take up a <span class="sidenote">Cornwallis takes up a position at Yorktown.</span>
defensive position in touch with the sea, and in August
he concentrated his troops at Yorktown on the bank of
the York river, where a peninsula is formed by that river
and the James flowing into the mouth of Chesapeake
Bay; the village of Gloucester on the opposite side of
the York river was also held. It was not a strong position,
and all depended on keeping command, of the water. For
once the English lost the command, and the consequence
was the loss of the army.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Naval
operations.
The
French
fleet
under de
Grasse
comes
into
touch
with
Washington
and
Lafayette.</div>

<p>At the end of March a strong French fleet under de
Grasse sailed from Brest for the West Indies. After
a few weeks’ operations among the islands, and taking
Tobago, de Grasse made for Cap François in Hayti and
found dispatches from Washington. Taking on board
3,500 French soldiers, he sailed for the North American
coast and reached the Chesapeake at the end of August.
The object was to co-operate with Washington and
de Rochambeau in blockading Cornwallis and compelling
him to surrender. Meanwhile a French squadron at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
Newport in Rhode Island, under de Barras, put out to
sea with a convoy containing the siege train, making
a wide circuit in order to escape detection by the English
ships and join de Grasse in Chesapeake Bay. On land
Lafayette, strengthened by a body of Pennsylvanians,
already harassed Cornwallis, especially charged to prevent
as far as possible a retreat to the south; while de Rochambeau
from Rhode Island joined Washington who was
facing New York, and the combined army, after threatening
an attack on Clinton, crossed the Hudson in August,
marched through New Jersey to Philadelphia, and
passing on to Virginia, with the help of French transports
appeared before Yorktown in the latter end of September. <span class="sidenote">Cornwallis besieged at Yorktown.</span>
Cornwallis was now besieged by 16,000 men on land and
an overwhelming fleet at sea.</p>

<p>The movement had been well planned and skilfully
executed. Clinton at New York had been misled by
a feint of attack, and on the sea the English had been
found wanting. When Rodney learnt that de Grasse
had left the West Indies for the North American coast,
in ill health himself and about to leave for England,
he dispatched Sir Samuel Hood in pursuit with fourteen
ships of the line. A stronger force was needed and had
apparently been intended by Rodney. Hood reached
the Chesapeake three or four days before de Grasse
arrived, and passing on to New York came under the <span class="sidenote">Ineffective movements of the English fleet.</span>
orders of a senior officer, Admiral Graves, who had at
the time but five ships with him. The combined squadron
sailed for the Chesapeake, and found that de Grasse
had forestalled them with a stronger fleet. They attacked
on the 5th of September, with no decisive result on either
side: for three or four days longer the two fleets faced
each other, then Graves returned to New York and de
Grasse went back to block Cornwallis, his manœuvres
having enabled de Barras in the meantime to bring in
his ships in safety to the Chesapeake.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cornwallis
surrenders
at Yorktown.</div>

<p>Cornwallis was now in hopeless case, unless Clinton
could relieve him. Expectation of relief was given,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
the 5th of October being named as the day on which
the relieving force would probably leave New York. On
the night of the 5th the Americans began their trenches,
on the 9th the guns opened fire: after a week’s fighting,
on the 17th, Cornwallis treated for surrender; and on the
19th, the day on which Clinton actually sailed from New
York to bring the promised aid, the British army laid down
their arms, sickness having reduced the number of fighting
men from 7,000 to barely 4,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Consequences
of the surrender.</div>

<p>Four years had passed almost to the day since the
similar disaster at Saratoga. The second surrender
practically finished the war, though there was still some
small fighting in the south, the English being driven
back to Charleston and Savannah. Savannah was
eventually evacuated in July, 1782, and Charleston in
the following December, by which date terms of peace
between Great Britain and the United States had already
been signed. Meanwhile in England Carleton had been <span class="sidenote">Carleton succeeds Clinton.</span>
nominated to take the place of Clinton as Commander-in-Chief
in America, Germain resigned, and in March, 1782,
Lord North’s ministry came to an end. The Whigs came
in pledged to make peace, Rockingham being Prime
Minister and Shelburne and Fox Secretaries of State.
Within four months Lord Rockingham died, and Shelburne <span class="sidenote">Negotiations for peace.</span>
became Prime Minister, Fox leaving the Government,
and the younger Pitt joining it as Chancellor of the
Exchequer. Already negotiations for peace were proceeding
at Paris, where Richard Oswald, a nominee of
Shelburne’s, had been treating with Franklin, complaisantly
entertaining every American demand. Rodney’s
great victory over de Grasse in the battle of the Saints,
on the 12th of April, 1782, enabled England to speak
with a firmer voice. The failure in September of the
combined efforts of France and Spain to take Gibraltar
again added strength: and Shelburne’s ministry was
enabled to conclude a peace, which, if it contrasted sadly
with the triumphant Treaty of 1763, was at least far
from being the capitulation of a ruined Power. On the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
30th of November, 1782, articles were signed between <span class="sidenote">Peace concluded and the Independence of the United States recognized.</span>
Oswald, on behalf of Great Britain, and the Commissioners
of the United States, ‘to be inserted in and to constitute
the treaty of Peace’ which was to be concluded when
Great Britain and France had come to terms. On the
20th of January, 1783, Preliminary Articles of Peace were
signed between Great Britain and France on the one hand
and between Great Britain and Spain on the other;
and on the following 3rd of September the Peace of
Versailles was finally concluded, treaties being made
by Great Britain with France, Spain, and the United
States, a treaty with the Netherlands having been signed
on the previous day. Under the first article of the treaty
with the United States the King of England acknowledged
the thirteen colonies then forming the United States
to be ‘free sovereign and Independent States’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Comparison
of the
American
War of
Independence
with the
late war
in South
Africa.</div>

<p>At the time of the late war in South Africa an
analogy was sometimes drawn between that war and the
War of American Independence. In some respects there
was similarity. In either case a group of British colonies
was primarily concerned, and in either case the British
Government was faced with the difficulty of transporting
large bodies of troops across the sea to a distant scene
of war, America in the eighteenth century before the days
of steam being for all practical purposes more remote than
South Africa in our own time. There were two distinct
spheres of operations in America in the earlier years of
the war, Canada and the Atlantic states, just as in
South Africa the war was divided between Natal and
the Cape Colony; and the Boer invasion of Natal and
investment of Ladysmith to some extent recalls the overrunning
of Canada by Montgomery’s troops and the
hemming up of Carleton inside Quebec. In both cases
there was the same kind of half knowledge of the country
and its conditions in the public mind in Great Britain,
and, curiously enough, in either case the estimate seems
to have been most at fault where fighting had been most
recent; in Natal, where less than twenty years had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
elapsed since the previous Boer war, and on the line
of Lake Champlain and the Hudson, presumed to be
well known to many who had served at a somewhat
shorter interval of time under Abercromby and Amherst,
and who encouraged Germain to give his confident instructions
to Burgoyne for a march to Albany. Distance,
transport, supplies, communications, rather than hard
fighting, were the main elements of either war; and the
description of the American war given in the <i>Annual
Register</i> for 1777, which has been already quoted,<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> that
it was ‘a war of posts, surprises, and skirmishes instead
of a war of battles’, would apply equally to the South
African war. But here the likeness ceases, and no
real parallel can be drawn between the two contests.
The American war was a civil war, Englishmen were
fighting Englishmen. The war in South Africa was
a war between two rival races. In the earlier war the
great forces which have been embodied in British colonization,
mental and physical vigour, forwardness and
tenacity, the forces of youth, which have the keeping
of the future, were in the main ranged against the mother
country: in the later war they contributed, as never
before, to the sum of national patriotism. In the earlier
war foreign nations intervened, with fatal effect, and
the sea power of England was crippled. In the later,
the struggle was kept within its original limits and
British ships went unmolested to and from South Africa.
Not least of all, while on the former occasion ministers
at home tried to do the work of the generals on the spot,
Carleton’s bitter comments on the disastrous result,
which have been quoted above<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>, could in no sense be
applied to the later crisis. As bearing on this last point, <span class="sidenote">Effect on war of submarine cables.</span>
it is interesting to speculate what would have happened
had submarine cables existed in the days of King George
the Third. The telegraph invites and facilitates interference
from home. It tends to minimize the responsibility,
and to check the initiative, of the men on the spot: and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
if the cables which now connect England and America,
had been in existence in the years 1776 and 1777, it
might be supposed that the commanders in America
would have been even more hampered than they were
by the meddling of the King, and his ministers. But
the evil was that, in the absence of the telegraph, interference
could not be corrected, and co-operation could
not be ensured. Germain laid down a rigid plan: a
second-rate man received precise instructions which he
felt bound to follow against his own judgement; and
for want of sure and speedy communication the cause
was lost. It is impossible to suppose that even the
King and Germain would have refused to modify their
plans, had they known what was passing from day to
day or from week to week: in other words, the invention
which more than any other has opened a door to undue
interference, would probably in the case in point have done
most to remedy the ignorant meddling which was the
prime cause of the disaster at Saratoga.</p>

<p>The War of American Independence was ‘by far the
most dangerous in which the British nation was ever
involved’.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> It was seen at the time that its issues would
colour all future history and modify for ever political
and commercial systems, but no prophet seemed to
contemplate a colonial future for Great Britain, and
Benjamin Franklin said ‘he would furnish Mr. Gibbon
with materials for writing the history of the Decline of
the British Empire’.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> Yet the present broad-based
Imperial system of Great Britain was for two reasons
the direct outcome of that war. While the United States
were still colonial possessions of Great Britain, they <span class="sidenote">Effects of the American War of Independence on the British Empire as a whole.</span>
overshadowed all others; and, had they remained
British possessions, their preponderance would in all
probability have steadily increased. It is quite possible
that the centre of the Empire might have been shifted
to the other side of the Atlantic; it is almost certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
that the colonial expansion of Great Britain would have
been mainly confined to North America. Nothing has
been more marked and nothing sounder in our recent
colonial history than the comparative uniformity of
development in the British Empire. In those parts of
the world which have been settled and not merely
conquered by Europeans, and which are still British
possessions, in British North America, Australasia, and
South Africa, there has been on the whole parity of
progress. No one of the three groups of colonies has in
wealth and population wholly out-distanced the others.
This fact has unquestionably made for strength and
permanence in the British Empire, and it is equally beyond
question that the spread of colonization within the
Empire would have been wanting, had Great Britain
retained her old North American colonies. Unequalled
in history was the loss of such colonies, and yet by that
loss, it may fairly be said, Great Britain has achieved
a more stable and a more world-wide colonial dominion.</p>

<p>But this result would not have been attained had not
the lesson taught by the American war sunk deep into
the minds of Englishmen. It is true that for a while
the moral drawn from this calamitous war was that
self-governing institutions should not be given to colonies
lest they should rebel, as did the Americans, and win
their independence: but, as the smart of defeat passed
away and men saw events and their causes in true perspective,
as Englishmen again multiplied out of England but
in lands which belonged to England, and as the old
questions again pressed for solution, the answer given
in a wiser and a broader age was dictated by remembrance
of the American war, and Lord Durham’s report embodied
the principles, on which has been based the present
colonial system of Great Britain. It was seen—but it
might not have been seen had the United States not won
their independence—that English colonists, like the
Greek colonists of old, go out on terms of being equal
not subordinate to those who are left behind, that when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
they have effectively planted another and a distant
land, they must within the widest limits be left to rule
themselves; that, whether they are right or whether
they are wrong, more perhaps when they are wrong
than when they are right, they cannot be made amenable
by force; that mutual good feeling, community of interest,
and abstention from pressing rightful claims to their
logical conclusion, can alone hold together a true colonial
empire.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Its effects
on
Canada.</div>

<p>Though the United States, in the war and in the treaty
which followed it, attained in the fullest possible measure
the objects for which they had contended, it is a question
whether, of all the countries concerned in the war, Canada
did not really gain most, notwithstanding the hardship
which she suffered in respect of the boundary line between
the Dominion and the United States. For Canada to
have a future as a nation, it was necessary, in the first
place, that she should be cut adrift from the French
colonial system as it existed in the eighteenth century.
This was secured as the result of the Seven Years’ War.
In the second place, it was necessary that she should not
be absorbed by and among the British colonies in North
America. This end was attained, and could only be
attained by what actually happened, viz., by the British
colonies in North America ceasing to belong to Great
Britain, while Canada was kept within the circle of the
British Empire. Had the United States remained
British possessions, Canada must eventually have come
into line with them, and been more or less lost among
the stronger and more populous provinces. The same
result would have followed, had the British Government
entertained, as their emissary Oswald did, Franklin’s
proposal that Canada should be ceded to the United
States. It would have followed too, in all probability,
if Canada had been left at the time independent both
of Great Britain and of the United States, for she would
have been too weak to stand alone. The result of the
war was to give prominence and individuality to Canada<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
as a component part of the British Empire; to bring
in a strong body of British colonists not displacing but
supplementing the French Canadians and antagonistic
to the United States from which they were refugees;
to revive the instinct of self-preservation which in old
days had kept Canada alive, and which is the mainspring
of national sentiment, by again directly confronting her
with a foreign Power; and at the same time to give her
the advantage of protection by and political connexion
with what was still to be the greatest sea-going and
colonizing nation of the world. The result of the War of
American Independence was to make the United States
a great nation; but it was a result which, whether with
England or without, they must in any case have achieved.
The war had also the effect, and no other cause could have
had a like effect, of making possible a national existence
for Canada, which possibility was to be converted into
a living and a potent fact by the second American war,
the war of 1812.</p>

Sir William Johnson had died in July, 1774; his nephew and son-in-law,

</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="label">[78]</a> Carleton’s account of the above, given in a letter to Dartmouth,
dated Montreal, June 7, 1775, is that on May 19 he received news
from Gage of the outbreak of hostilities, i.e. the fight at Lexington,
coupled with a request that he would ‘send the 7th Regiment with
some companies of Canadians and Indians to Crown Point, in order
to make a diversion and favour his (Gage’s) operations’. The next
morning news reached Quebec ‘that one, Benedict Arnold, said to
be a native of Connecticut, and a horse jockey, landed a considerable
number of armed men at St. John’s: distant from this town (Montreal)
eight leagues, about eight in the morning of the 18th, surprised the
detachment of the 26th doing duty there, consisting of a sergeant and
ten men, and made them prisoners, seized upon the King’s sloop,
batteaus, and every other military store, and a few hours after departed,
carrying off the craft, prisoners, and stores they had seized. From
this party we had the first information of the rebels being in arms
upon the lakes, and of their having, under the command of said
Arnold, surprised Ticonderoga, Crown Point, the detachment of the
26th doing duty at these two places, and all the craft employed upon
those lakes’.... ‘The same evening another express brought an
account of the rebels having landed at St. John’s a second time, in
the night, between the 18th and 19th.’ Shortt and Doughty, pp. 453-5.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_79" href="#FNanchor_79" class="label">[79]</a> This seems to have been an under-estimate. There were apparently
at the time three British regiments in Canada, the 7th, the 8th, and

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_82" href="#FNanchor_82" class="label">[82]</a> Chief Justice Hey saw what a strong position Canada held, from
a military point of view, in regard to the other North American colonies.
In his letter to the Lord Chancellor of August 28, 1775, he wrote,
‘It appears to me that while England has a firm hold of this country,
which a good body of troops and nothing else will give her, her cause
with the colonies can never be desperate, though she should not have
an inch of ground in her possession in any one of them: from this

<p><a id="Footnote_86" href="#FNanchor_86" class="label">[86]</a> The general view seems to have been that Chambly might have
held out longer, and that the commander, Major Stopford, was shielded
by his aristocratic connexions, but the <i>Annual Register</i> for 1776 (p. 5)
says that it ‘was in no very defensible condition’, and Carleton seems
to have found no fault with its surrender. See the entry on p. 110
of Parliamentary Paper, Cd. 2201, 1904, <i>Historical MS. Commission,
Report on American manuscripts in the Royal Institution of Great Britain</i>,
vol. i. Sir Guy Carleton to (Lord Barrington), May 21, 1777, ‘has

</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_87" href="#FNanchor_87" class="label">[87]</a> The <i>Annual Register</i> for 1776, p. 12, makes Montgomery’s advance
from Montreal to Quebec a kind of repetition of Arnold’s march.
‘Their march was in winter, through bad roads, in a severe climate,
beneath the fall of the first snows, and therefore made under great
hardships.’ He seems, on the contrary, to have come down the river
in the captured British vessels.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88" class="label">[88]</a> There is or was a dispute about the date. Kingsford makes it

30-1. See Sir James Le Moyne’s Paper on the Assault on Quebec in
1775, in the <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society of Canada</i>, 1899.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_97" href="#FNanchor_97" class="label">[97]</a> There is an interesting account of the incident at the Cedars in
Stone’s <i>Life of Brant</i> (1838 ed.), vol. i, p. 153, &amp;c. Stone says that
Forster had with him one company of regulars and nearly 600 Indians,
led by Joseph Brant, the celebrated Mohawk chief. But in spite
of the note to p. 151 there seems no doubt that Brant, who had gone
to England on a visit in the previous autumn, did not start on his
return voyage till late in May or June, and did not arrive at New
York till July, long after the event at the Cedars. See Colonel Cruikshank’s
paper on ‘Joseph Brant in the American Revolution’, April,
1897, <i>Transactions of the Canadian Institute</i>, vol. v, pp. 243, &amp;c.,
Colonel Cruikshank says that Brant sailed from Falmouth early in
June, 1776, and reached New York on July 29, where he fought under
Howe. Probably the affair of the Cedars was confounded with the
fighting at St. John’s and the attack on Montreal when Ethan Allen
was taken prisoner in 1775. Brant seems to have been present in
these actions.</p>

Sackville, see the letter from Lord Vere to Earl Temple of December
19, 1769, in the <i>Grenville Papers</i> (edited by W. J. Smith, 1853, John

<i>Letters</i> (Mrs. Paget Toynbee’s edition, Clarendon Press, 1904).
In a letter to George Montagu, July 23, 1763, Walpole gives a description
of Drayton, and refers to Lady Betty Germain as ‘its divine
old mistress’. Drayton belonged to the Earls of Peterborough, the
Mordaunt family. The daughter and heiress of the last earl married
Sir John Germain, and left him the property. He married, as his
second wife, Lady Elizabeth Berkeley, the Lady Betty Germain in
question, and left Drayton to her, expressing a wish that if she had
no children, she should leave it to one of the Sackvilles, which she
accordingly did. Lady Betty Germain, whose father was Viceroy of
Ireland, was a friend of Swift.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_129" href="#FNanchor_129" class="label">[129]</a> St. Leger says definitely, ‘Sir John Johnson put himself at the
head of this party.’ Stone, on the other hand, makes out that Sir
John Johnson remained behind in the camp and was at that part of
it which was surprised by Willett (See Stone’s <i>Life of Brant</i>, 1838 ed.,
vol. i, p. 235, note). St. Leger says that he ‘could not send above
80 white men, Rangers and troops included, with the whole corps of
Indians’, but all the accounts seem to agree in placing the number
of Indians at 400 and no more.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_130" href="#FNanchor_130" class="label">[130]</a> The details of the fighting at Oriskany, and Willett’s sortie from
the fort, are more confusing and contradictory even than those of
most battles and sieges. The American accounts make Oriskany an
American victory, and Willett’s sortie a taking possession of the whole
British camp, the contents of which, after the defenders had been put
to flight, were carried off to the fort in seven wagons which made three
trips between the fort and the camp. St. Leger, no doubt minimizing
what happened, reported that the sortie resulted in no ‘further advantage
than frightening some squaws and pilfering the packs of the
warriors which they left behind them’. From the contemporary plan of
the operations at Fort Stanwix it seems clear that Willett surprised only
the post at the lower landing-place and not the whole British camp.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_146" href="#FNanchor_146" class="label">[146]</a> It is not easy to make out the details of the fighting. After the
battle of September 19, the two armies were said to be only about
half a mile distant from each other, but on October 7, according to
Burgoyne’s dispatch, after advancing for some time he formed his
troops within three-quarters of a mile of the enemy. The advance
was apparently not direct but diagonal against the extreme left of
the Americans. The main English camp near the river, where there
was a bridge of boats, does not seem to have been at all molested,
though it was presumably drawn back in the following night. Breyman’s
camp which was stormed is shown on the plan appended to
the <i>State of the Expedition from Canada</i>, as well in the rear of the
extreme right of the English line.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_147" href="#FNanchor_147" class="label">[147]</a> Horace Walpole, writing to the Countess of Upper Ossory on
November 3, 1777, seems to be referring to reports of the battle at
Freeman’s Farm. ‘If your angel would be seeing, why did he not
put on his spectacles and hover over Arnold, who has beaten the
vapouring Burgoyne and destroyed his magazines? Carleton, who
was set aside for General Hurlothrumbo, is gone to save him and the
remains of his army if he can.’ On November 13 he writes to the
same, ‘General Swagger is said to be entrenched at Saratoga, but
I question whether he will be left at leisure to continue his Commentaries:
one Arnold is mighty apt to interrupt him.’ Authentic news
of Burgoyne’s surrender did not reach England till December 1.
Writing to Sir Horace Mann on December 4, Walpole says: ‘On
Tuesday night came news from Carleton at Quebec, which indeed had
come from France earlier, announcing the total annihilation (as to
America) of Burgoyne’s army.... Burgoyne is said to be wounded
in three places, his vanquisher, Arnold, is supposed to be dead of his
wounds.’ It will be noted that Arnold is made the hero on the American
side, and that there is no mention of Walpole’s godson, Gates. Walpole
contemplated invasion of Canada and possible loss of Quebec as the
result of the disaster.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_148" href="#FNanchor_148" class="label">[148]</a> The above account has been taken almost entirely from the original
dispatches, documents, and evidence published in <i>A State of the Expedition
from Canada as laid before the House of Commons by Lieutenant-General
Burgoyne</i>. London, 1780. Burgoyne, in a private letter to
Howe of 20th October, attributed the surrender in part to the fact that
his troops were not all British. See <i>Report on American Manuscripts
in the Royal Institution</i> (1904), vol. i, p. 140.</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_149" href="#FNanchor_149" class="label">[149]</a> Article 6 of the Treaty of Paris between France and the United
States, dated February 6, 1778, ran as follows: ‘The most Christian
King renounces for ever the possession of the islands of Bermudas as
well as of any part of the continent of America which before the
Treaty of Paris in 1763 or in virtue of that treaty were acknowledged
to belong to the Crown of Great Britain or to the United States heretofore
called British colonies or which are at this time or have lately
been under the Power of the King and Crown of Great Britain.’
(<i>Annual Register</i>, 1778, p. 341.)</p>
</div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_150" href="#FNanchor_150" class="label">[150]</a> Stone’s <i>Life of Brant</i>, and among recent books, Halsey’s <i>Old New
York Frontier</i>, give good accounts of this border war from the American
side. Fortunately the subject lies in the main outside the scope of
the present book. It would probably be fair to say that there were
undoubtedly great and horrible barbarities, not confined to one side
only, and on the other hand that there was much exaggeration as,
e.g. when Campbell in <i>Gertrude of Wyoming</i> made Joseph Brant,
who never took any part at all in the raid, one of the monsters of the
story.</p>

<p>The Wyoming valley had been colonized from Connecticut and was
claimed by and at the time actually incorporated with Connecticut,
though geographically within the state of Pennsylvania. The settlers
had sent a considerable contingent to Washington’s army and their
homes were in consequence but slenderly guarded.</p>

<p>On Pownall’s ‘map of the Middle British Colonies in North America’,
published March 25, 1776, on the western side of the east branch of
the Susquehanna river, appears the following: ‘Colony from Wioming
Connecticut.’</p>

<p>In the ‘Topographical Description’ attached to the above map
there is the following note at pp. 35-6: ‘This Place and the District
is now settled by a populous Colony, which swarmed and came forth
from Connecticut. The People of Connecticut say, that their Charter and
the grant of Lands under it was prior to that of Pennsylvania; that
the grant of Lands to them extended within the Latitudes of their
Grant (except where possessed by other powers at that Time) to the
South Seas. They allow New York and New Jersey to have been so
possessed at the time of their Grant, but say, that their right emerges
again at the West boundary of those Provinces. Mr. Penn and the
People of Pennsylvania who have taken Grants under him say, that
this District is in the very Heart of the Province of Pennsylvania.
On this State of Claims the Two Colonies are in actual war, which
they have not even remitted against each other here, although united
in arms against Great Britain 1775.’</p>

<p>The note is interesting as showing how very far from amicable were
the relations of the colonies to each other when the War of Independence
broke out, cf. the case of the Vermont settlers and New York
referred to at the beginning of this chapter.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE TREATY OF 1783 AND THE UNITED EMPIRE
LOYALISTS</span></h2>

<p>In the War of American Independence the English
had no one to match against Washington. In the negotiations
for the peace which ended the war they had no <span class="sidenote">The Treaty of 1783.</span>
one to match against Benjamin Franklin. The outcome
of Franklin’s astuteness was the Treaty of 1783,<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
by which Great Britain acknowledged the independence
of the thirteen United States, and which alike for Great
Britain and for Canada was rather the beginning than
the end of troubles.</p>

<p>The first words of the second article of the treaty,
which purported to determine the boundaries of the
United States, were as follows, ‘That all disputes which
might arise in future on the subject of the boundaries
of the said United States may be prevented, it is hereby
agreed and declared that the following are and shall
be their boundaries.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
boundary
disputes.</div>

<p>The words were no doubt used in good faith; but,
as a matter of fact, nowhere in the world has there been
such a long series of boundary disputes between two
nations, as in North America between Great Britain and
the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">In 1783
the geography
of
North
America
was little
known.</div>

<p>The disputes were to a certain extent inevitable.
When the Treaty of 1783 was signed, half North America
was unknown; while within the colonized or semi-colonized
area, the coast-line, the courses of the rivers,
the lie of the land, had never been accurately mapped
out. There were well-known names and phrases, but
the precise points which they designated were uncertain.
It was easy to use geographical expressions in drawing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
up a treaty, but exceedingly difficult, when the treaty
had been signed, to decide what was the correct interpretation
of its terms. The matter was further complicated
by the fact that in 1783, and for many years afterwards,
until the Dominion Act was passed, Nova Scotia
was a separate colony from Canada; while in the year <span class="sidenote">The disputes were between provinces as well as nations.</span>
after the treaty, 1784, New Brunswick was carved out
of Nova Scotia and also became a separate colony.
Similarly the United States, though federated, were still
separate entities, and Maine was in 1820 separated from
Massachusetts, just as New Brunswick had been cut
off from Nova Scotia. Thus on either side there were
provincial as well as national claims to be considered
and adjusted; and it resulted that the Treaty of 1783,
which was to have been a final settlement of the quarrel
between Great Britain and her old North American
colonies, left an aftermath of troublesome questions,
causing constant friction, endless negotiations, and a
succession of supplementary conventions. A summary
of the controversies and conventions, out of which the
International Boundary was evolved, will be found in
the Second Appendix to this book. There is more than
one reason why such a multiplicity of disputes arose,
why the disputes were so prolonged and at times so
dangerous, and why the issues were as a rule unfavourable
to Great Britain and to Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Treaty
of 1783
made a
precedent
for future
American
successes
in diplomacy.</div>

<p>First and foremost, not only was the original Treaty
of 1783, in the then state of geographical knowledge,
or rather of geographical ignorance, necessarily both inadequate
and inaccurate, but in addition those who negotiated
it on the British side, in their anxiety to make
peace, were, as has been stated, completely outmatched
in bargaining by the representatives of the United States.
The result was that the weak points of the treaty, and
the conspicuous success of the Americans in securing it,
infected all subsequent negotiations. The wording of
the document was played for all and more than it was
worth, and there grew up something like a tradition that,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
as each new issue arose between the two nations,
the Americans should take and the English should
concede.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Great
Britain
was more
weighted
by foreign
complications
than the
United
States.</div>

<p>In the second place, Great Britain was always at a
disadvantage in negotiating with the United States,
owing to her many vulnerable interests and her complicated
foreign relations. The American Government was,
so to speak, on the spot, concentrating on each point
exclusive attention and undivided strength. The British
Government was at a distance, with its eyes on all parts
of the world, and remembering only too well how the
first great quarrel with the United States had resulted
in a world in arms against Great Britain. At each
step in the endless chaffering British Ministers had to
count the cost more anxiously than those who spoke
for a young and strong nation, as a rule untrammeled
by relations to other foreign Powers and as a rule, though
not always, assured of public support in America in
proportion to the firmness of their demands and the
extent of their claims.</p>

<p>Lastly, it has often been said that Canada has grievously
suffered through British diplomacy. This is to a
large extent true, but one great reason has been that
Canada, as it exists to-day, was not in existence when <span class="sidenote">Canada was not one nation.</span>
most of the boundary questions came up for settlement.
The interests of a Dominion—except in potentiality—were
not at stake, and there was no Canadian nation
to make its voice heard. For two-thirds of a century
after the United States became an independent nation,
in the North-West the Hudson’s Bay Company or its
rivals in the fur trade, on the Pacific coast the beginnings
of a small separate British colony, were nearly all that
was in evidence. Boundary questions in North America
between Great Britain and the United States could be
presented, and were presented, as of unequal value to
the two parties. Any given area in dispute was portrayed
as of vital importance to the United States, on the ground
that it involved the limits of their homeland and their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
people’s heritage. The same area, it would be plausibly
argued, was of little consequence to Great Britain as
affecting only a distant corner of some one of the most
remote and least known of her many dependencies.
This was inevitable while Canada was in the making.
Yet in spite of errors in diplomacy, and in spite of what
on a review of all the conditions must fairly be judged
to have been great and singular difficulties, the net
result has been to secure for the Canadian nation a
territory which most peoples on the world’s surface would
regard as a great and a goodly inheritance.</p>

<p>The second article of the Treaty of 1783, which attempted
to define the boundaries of the United States and therefore
of Canada also, was by no means the only provision
of the treaty which affected Canada. The third article
was of much importance, giving to American fishermen
certain fishing rights on the coasts of British North
America; but the fourth, fifth and sixth articles require
more special notice, inasmuch as, though Canada was not
actually mentioned in them, their indirect effect was
to create a British population in Canada, to make <span class="sidenote">Provisions in the 1783 treaty which referred to the Loyalists.</span>
Canada a British colony instead of a foreign dependency
of Great Britain, and to strongly accentuate
the severance between those parts of North America
which held to the British connexion and the provinces
which had renounced their allegiance to the British
Crown.</p>

<p>The fourth article provided ‘that creditors on either
side shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery
of the full value in sterling money of all bonâ fide debts
heretofore contracted’.</p>

<p>The fifth article, while discriminating between those
who had and those who had not borne arms against
the United States, was to the effect that Congress should
‘earnestly recommend’ to the several states restitution
of confiscated property and rights, and a revision of
the laws directed against the Loyalists of America.
The sixth article prohibited future confiscations and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
prosecutions in the case of persons who had taken part
in the late war.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bitter
feeling
in the
United
States
against
the
Loyalists.</div>

<p>In the negotiations, which preceded the conclusion of
peace, no point was more strongly debated between the
commissioners of the two countries than the question
of the treatment to be awarded to those who had adhered
to the British cause in the American states during the
war. The British Government was bound in common
honesty to use every effort to safeguard the lives and
interests of those who had remained loyal under every
stress of persecution. On the American side, on the
other hand, there was the most bitter feeling against
the Tories, as they were called, a feeling generally shared
by the members of the revolutionary party from Washington
downwards. As in all cases of the kind, Loyalists
included good and bad, worthy and unworthy, interested
placemen or merchants as well as men who acted on
and suffered for principle alone. There were men among
them of high standing and reputation, such as William
Franklin the Loyalist Governor of New Jersey, only son
of Benjamin Franklin, and Sir William Pepperell, grandson
of the man who besieged and took Louisbourg in 1745.
There were also men of the type of Arnold, who deserved
to be held as traitors. Many of the Loyalists had fought
hard, and barbarities could be laid, directly or indirectly,
to their charge. Their record was associated with the
memories of the border war, of Wyoming and Cherry
Valley; but equally on the American side could be found
instances of cruelty and ruthlessness. The war had been
a civil war, long drawn out, spasmodic, fought through
largely by guerilla bands. It did not lie with either
side to monopolize claims to righteousness or to perpetuate
bitterness against their foes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
sufferings
of the
Loyalists
were
increased
by the
spasmodic
operations
of the
English
in the
war,</div>

<p>There were two special causes which made the hard
lot of the Loyalists harder than it might otherwise have
been. The first was the unfortunate action of the English
in occupying cities or tracts of country and then again<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
abandoning them. When Howe evacuated Boston, over
900 Loyalists are said to have left with him for Halifax.
When the British army was withdrawn from Philadelphia
in June, 1778, 3,000 Loyalists followed in its train.
But the misery caused by the uncertain policy of the
British Government or the British generals cannot be
measured merely by the actual number of refugees on
each occasion. A very large proportion of the American
population was at heart neutral, and they suffered from
not knowing whom to trust and whom to obey at a given
time and place. In the autumn of 1776 New Jersey
was brought under complete British control. The disaster
at Trenton supervened, and in about six months the
whole country was given up. Much the same happened
in the southern states; at one time the English, at another
the Americans were masters of this or that district. The
result was that bitterness was intensified by prolonged
uncertainty and suspicion. Numbers of citizens, who
only asked which master they should serve, suffered at
the hands of both. There would have been far less
misery and far better feeling if from the beginning to
the end of the war certain areas and no more had always
remained in British occupation, instead of towns and provinces
being bandied about from one side to the other.</p>

<div class="sidenote">and by
the separate
action
of the
several
States.</div>

<p>The second special cause of suffering to the Loyalists
was the separate action of the several states. England
was not fighting one nation but thirteen different communities;
and it may be said that in each of the thirteen
there was civil war. The smaller the area in which
there is strife, the meaner and more bitter the strife
will be. With a great national struggle were intertwined
petty rivalries, local jealousies, family dissensions.
Men remembered old grudges, paid off old scores, reproduced
in the worst forms the features which in quieter
times had disfigured the narrow provincial life of the
separate states. Had the states been one instead of
many, there would have been a wider patriotism and
a broader outlook, for Congress with all its faults was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
a larger minded body than a state legislature. Had
they again been all one, there would not have been a
series of unwholesome precedents for persecution of the
minority. As it was, each state passed law after law
against the Loyalists, and each in its turn could point
to what its neighbour had done, in the hope of making
a further exhibition of patriotism, more extravagant
and more unjust.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Powerlessness
of Congress
in the
matter.</div>

<p>How helpless the central body was in the matter,
as compared with the separate sovereign states, is shown
by the wording of the fifth article of the Peace. All that
the American commissioners could be induced to sign
was that Congress should ‘earnestly recommend to the
legislatures of the respective states’ a policy of amnesty
and restitution. It does not seem to have been anticipated
that the state legislatures would comply with the recommendation.
At any rate it appears that the emissaries
of the United States who conducted the peace negotiations
were reluctant to consent even to this small concession;
that it was in after years represented on the
American side as a mere form of words, necessary to
bring matters to a conclusion and to save the face of
the British Government; that its inadequacy was
hotly assailed in both Houses of the British Parliament;
and that it proved to be as a matter of fact in the main
a dead letter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Debates
in Parliament
on the
question
of the
Loyalists.</div>

<p>Very bitter were the comments made in Parliament
upon these provisions in the treaty by the opponents
of Shelburne’s ministry. On the 17th of February, 1783,
the Preliminary Articles of Peace were discussed in either
House. In the House of Lords Lord Carlisle led the
attack, moving an amendment in which the subject of the <span class="sidenote">The debate in the House of Lords.</span>
Loyalists was prominently mentioned. The terms of
the amendment lamented the necessity for subscribing
to articles ‘which, considering the relative situation of
the belligerent Powers, we must regard as inadequate
to our just expectations and derogatory to the honour
and dignity of Great Britain’. Various strong speeches<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
followed, Lord Walsingham did not mince his words,
nor did Lord Townshend. Lord Stormont spoke of the
Loyalists as ‘men whom Britain was bound in justice
and honour, gratitude and affection, and every tie to
provide for and protect. Yet alas for England as well
as them they were made a price of peace’. Lord George
Germain, now Lord Sackville, who had so largely contributed
to the calamitous issue of the war, was to the
front in condemning the cruel abandonment of the
Loyalists. In order to prove the futility of the terms
intended to safeguard their interests, he referred to
a resolution passed by the Legislature of Virginia as late
as the 17th of December previously, to the effect that
all demands for restitution of confiscated property were
wholly inadmissible. Lord Loughborough in a brilliant
speech spoke out that ‘in ancient or in modern history
there cannot be found an instance of so shameful a
desertion of men who have sacrificed all to their duty
and to their reliance upon our faith’. The House sat
until 4.30 on the following morning, the attendance
of peers being at one period of the debate larger than
on any previous occasion in the reign of George the Third;
and the division gave the Government a majority of
thirteen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the House of Commons were also engaged
in discussing the Peace, and here Lord John Cavendish <span class="sidenote">The Debate in the House of Commons.</span>
moved an amendment to the Address, which was supplemented
by a further amendment in which Lord North
raised the case of the Loyalists. The Government
fared ill at the hands of the best speakers in the House,
of all shades of opinion. ‘Never was the honour, the
humanity, the principles, the policy of a nation so grossly
abused,’ said Lord North now happy in opposition,
‘as in the desertion of those men who are now exposed
to every punishment that desertion and poverty can
inflict because they were not rebels,’ and he denounced
the discrimination made in the fifth article of the Peace
against those who had borne arms for Great Britain.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
Lord Mulgrave spoke of the Peace as ‘a lasting monument
of national disgrace’. Fox was found in opposition to
Shelburne with whom he had parted company, and on
the same side as his old opponent Lord North with
whom he was soon to join hands. Burke spoke of the
vast number of Loyalists who ‘had been deluded by this
country and had risked everything in our cause’. Sheridan
used bitter words to the same effect; and even Wilberforce,
who seconded the Address on the Government side, had <span class="sidenote">The Government defeated.</span>
to own that, when he considered the case of the Loyalists,
‘there he saw his country humiliated.’ The debate
went on through the night, and when the division was
taken at 7.30 the next morning, the ministers found
themselves beaten by sixteen votes.</p>

<p>But the House of Commons had not yet done with
the Peace, or with the ministry. Four days later, on <span class="sidenote">Resolutions by Lord John Cavendish.</span>
the 21st of February, Lord John Cavendish moved five
resolutions in the House. The first three resolutions
confirmed the Peace and led to little debate, but the
fourth and fifth were a direct attack on the Government.
The fourth resolution was as follows, ‘The concessions
made to the adversaries of Great Britain, by the said
Provisional Treaty and Preliminary Articles, are greater
than they were entitled to, either from the actual situation
of their respective possessions, or from their comparative
strength.’ The terms of the fifth resolution were, ‘that
this House do feel the regard due from this nation to
every description of men, who, with the risk of their
lives and the sacrifice of their property, have distinguished
their loyalty, and been conspicuous for their fidelity
during a long and calamitous war, and to assure His
Majesty that they shall take every proper method to
relieve them, which the state of the circumstances of this
country will permit.’ A long debate on the fourth
resolution ended in the defeat of the Government by
seventeen votes; and, the Opposition being satisfied <span class="sidenote">Shelburne’s ministry defeated.</span>
by carrying this vote of censure, the fifth resolution
was withdrawn. The result of the night’s work was to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
turn out Shelburne and his colleagues, and to make
way for the famous coalition of Fox and North, which
had been amply foreshadowed in the debates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Unnecessary
concessions
made on
the English
side
in the
Peace of
1783.</div>

<p>It will be noted that, though the case of the Loyalists
was made a text for denouncing the terms of the Peace,
the Government was defeated avowedly not so much on
the ground of dishonourable conduct to the friends of
England as on that of having made unnecessary concessions.
The case of the Opposition was strong, and the
case of the Government was weak, because sentiment
was backed by common sense. The Loyalists had been
shabbily treated, without any adequate reason either
for sacrificing them or for making various other concessions.
That was the verdict of the House of Commons
then, and it is the verdict of history now. England had
become relatively not weaker but stronger since the
disaster at Yorktown, and the United States were at
least as much in need of peace as was the mother country.
The Americans had done more by bluff than by force,
and the wholesale cession of territory, the timorous
abandonment of men and places, was an unnecessary
price of peace. The case of the Opposition was overwhelming,
and it carried conviction in spite of the antecedents
of many of those who spoke for it. North and
Sackville, who declaimed against the terms which had
been conceded, were the men who had mismanaged the
war. Fox was to the front in attacking the Peace, and
with reason, for he had been the chief opponent in the
Rockingham cabinet of Shelburne and his emissary
Oswald, but Fox beyond all men had lent his energies
to supporting the Americans against his own country
in the time of her trial.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Excuses
made for
the policy
of the
British
Government
with
regard
to the
Loyalists.</div>

<p>What the Government pleaded in defence of the articles
which related to the Loyalists was first, that they could
not secure peace on any other terms; secondly, that the
Americans would carry out the terms honourably and
in good faith; and thirdly that, if the terms were not
carried out, England would compensate her friends.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
The first plea, as we have seen, was rejected. The second
plea events proved to be ill founded. Congress made
the recommendation to the state legislatures which the <span class="sidenote">Persecution of the Loyalists in the various states.</span>
fifth article prescribed, but no attention was paid to it.
‘Confiscation still went on actively, governors of the
states were urged to exchange lists of the proscribed
persons, that no Tory might find a resting-place in the
United States, and in nearly every state they were disfranchized’.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
The Acts against the Loyalists were not
repealed, and in some cases were supplemented. In
some states life was not safe any more than property,
and the revolution closed with a reign of terror. South
Carolina stood almost alone in passing, in March, 1784,
an Act for restitution of property and permitting Loyalists
to return to the state. In Pennsylvania Tories were
still disfranchized as late as 1801.</p>

<p>In retaliation for the non-fulfilment of the fifth and
sixth articles of the treaty relating to the Loyalists,
as well as of the fourth article by which creditors on
either side were to meet with no lawful impediment in
recovering their bonâ fide debts,<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> the British Government,
in their turn, refused to carry out in full the
seventh article under which all the places which were
occupied by British garrisons within the borders of
the United States were to be evacuated ‘with all
convenient speed’; and it was not until the year 1796,
after further negotiations had taken place and a new
treaty, Jay’s Treaty of 1794, had been signed, that the
inland posts were finally given up. Meanwhile the
Government took in hand compensation for the sorely
tried Loyalists, redeeming the pledges which had been
given and the honour of the nation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Compensation
given
to the
Loyalists
from
Imperial
Funds.</div>

<p>A full account of the steps which were taken to compensate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
in money the American Loyalists is given in
a <i>Historical view of the Commission for inquiry into
the losses, services and claims of the American Loyalists</i>
which was published in London in 1815, by John Eardley
Wilmot, one of the commissioners. Compensation or relief
had been going on during the war, for, as has been
seen, each stage of the war and each abandonment of
a city implied a number of refugees with claims on the
justice or the liberality of the British Government. Thus
Wilmot tells us that in the autumn of 1782 the sums
issued by the Treasury amounted to an annual amount
of £40,280 distributed among 315 persons, over and
above occasional sums in gross to the amount of between
£17,000 and £18,000 per annum for the three last years,
being payments applied to particular or extraordinary
losses or services. Shelburne named two members of
Parliament as commissioners to inquire into the application
of these relief funds; and they reduced the amount
stated above to £25,800, but by June, 1783, added another
£17,445, thus bringing up the total to £43,245.</p>

<p>In July, 1783, the Portland administration, which had
taken the place of Shelburne’s ministry and which
included Fox and North, passed an Act ‘appointing
commissioners to inquire into the losses and services
of all such persons who have suffered in their rights,
properties and professions during the late unhappy
dissensions in America, in consequence of their loyalty to
His Majesty and attachment to the British Government’.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
The Act was passed for two years only, expiring in July,
1785; and the 25th of March, 1784, was fixed as the
date by which all claims were to be sent in. But the time
for settlement was found to be too short. In the session
of 1785 the Act was renewed and amplified, and the time
for receiving claims was extended under certain conditions
till May 1st, 1786. In that year the Act was again renewed,
and it was further renewed in 1787. Commissioners
were sent out to Nova Scotia, to Canada, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
United States. On the 6th of June, 1788, there was a
debate in Parliament on the subject of compensation,
which was followed by passing a new Act<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>, the operation
of which was again twice extended, and in 1790 the
long inquiry came to an end. The total grant allowed was
£3,112,455, including a sum of £253,000 awarded to the
Proprietaries or the trustees of the Proprietaries of
Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Virginia and Maryland,
the Penn family receiving the sum of £100,000 converted
into an annuity of £4,000 per annum.</p>

<p>It was a long drawn out inquiry, and the unfortunate
Loyalists chafed at the delay; but the outcome was
not illiberal and showed that England had not forgotten
her friends. William Pitt, who as Prime Minister carried
the matter through, had been Chancellor of the Exchequer
in Shelburne’s ministry which was responsible for the
articles of the Peace, and his subsequent action testified
that amid the many liabilities of England which he
was called upon to face, he well remembered the pledges
given in respect of the Loyalists of America.</p>

<p>The number of claimants who applied for money
compensation was 5,072: 954 claims were withdrawn
or not prosecuted, and the number of claims examined
was 4,118.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> The very large majority of the Loyalists
therefore did not participate in the grant, but for a great
many of them homes, grants of land and, for the time
being, rations were found in Canada, where General
Haldimand and after him Guy Carleton, then Lord
Dorchester, cared for the friends of England. Among
the most deserving and the most valuable of the refugees <span class="sidenote">The Loyalist soldiers.</span>
were the members of ‘His Majesty’s Provincial Regiments’,
the various Loyalist corps raised in America, the commanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
officers of which, on the 14th of March, 1783, presented
a touching and dignified memorial to Carleton while still
Commander-in-Chief at New York. They set out their
claims and services. They asked that provision should
be made for the disabled, the widows, and the orphans;
that the rank of the officers might be permanent in
America and that they might be placed on half pay upon
the reduction of their regiments; and ‘that grants of
land may be made to them in some of His Majesty’s
American provinces, and that they may be assisted
in making settlements, in order that they and their
children may enjoy the benefits of the British Government’.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Numbers,
with
places,
and destinations
of the
Loyalists.</div>

<p>Where did the Loyalists come from, where did they
go, and what was their number? The questions are
difficult to answer. In all the states there were many
Loyalists, though the numbers were much larger in some
than in others, and varied at different times according
to special circumstances or the characters and actions
of local leaders on either side. New England and Virginia
were to the front on the Patriot, Whig, or Revolutionary
side. In New England Massachusetts, as always, took
the lead. Here the Loyalist cause was weakened and
depressed by the early evacuation of Boston and the
departure of a large number of Loyalist citizens who
accompanied Howe’s army when it left for Halifax.
Of the other New England states, Connecticut, though
it supplied a large number of men to Washington’s army,
seems to have contained relatively more Loyalists than
the other New England states, probably because it
bordered on the principal Loyalist stronghold, New
York. In Virginia Washington’s personal influence
counted for much, and the King’s governor Lord Dunmore,
by burning down the town of Norfolk, would seem to have
alienated sympathies from the British side. New York <span class="sidenote">New York the principal Loyalist state.</span>
was the last state to declare for independence. Throughout
the war it contained a stronger proportion of Loyalists<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
than any other state, and of the claims to compensation
which were admitted by the commissioners quite one-third
were credited to New York. The commercial
interests of the port, traditional jealousy of New England,
neighbourhood to Canada, made for the British connexion.
Family and church interests were strong, the De Lanceys
leading the Episcopalian party on the side of the King,
as against the Livingstons and the Presbyterians and
Congregationalists who threw in their lot with the Revolution.
Most of all, after Howe occupied New York, it
was held strongly as the British head quarters till the end
of the war, and became the resort of Loyalist refugees
from other parts of America. In Pennsylvania the
Loyalists were numerous. Here the Quaker influence
was strong, opposed to war and to revolution. As
already stated, when Philadelphia was abandoned, 3,000
Loyalists left with the British army. In the south the
Loyalists were strong, but in the back country where
there were comparatively new settlers, many of Scotch
descent, rather than on the coast. In North Carolina
parties are said to have been evenly divided. In South
Carolina, and possibly in Georgia also, the Loyalists
seem at one time to have preponderated. When the
British garrisons at Charleston and Savannah were
finally withdrawn, 13,271 Loyalists were enumerated as
intending to leave also, including 8,676 blacks. But any
calculation is of little avail, for Loyalists were made and
unmade by the vicissitudes of the war. In America, as
in other countries in revolutionary times, it must be
supposed that the stalwarts on either side were very far
from including the whole population.</p>

<p>If it is not easy to trace where the Loyalists came
from, it is equally difficult with any accuracy to state,
except in general terms, where they all went. It was
not a case of a single wave of emigration starting from
a given point and directed to a given point. For years
refugees were drifting off in one direction and another.
Many went during the war overland to Canada. Many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
were carried by sea to Nova Scotia. A large number
went to England. Before and after the conclusion of the
Peace there was considerable emigration from the southern
states to Florida, the Bahamas, and the West Indies.
But Canada, including Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, <span class="sidenote">The Loyalists in Canada.</span>
became the chief permanent home of the Loyalists.
It was the country which wanted them most, and where
they found a place not as isolated refugees but as a
distinct and an honoured element in the population.
The coming of the Loyalists to Canada created the
province of New Brunswick and that of Ontario or Upper
Canada.</p>

<p>As far as dates can be given for an emigration which,
was spread over a number of years, 1783 may be taken
as the birth year of the Loyalist settlements in Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick, and 1784 as that of Upper
Canada. We have an accurate official account of the
Loyalists in the maritime provinces in the year 1784, <span class="sidenote">Loyalist colonization of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.</span>
entitled a report on Nova Scotia by Colonel Robert Morse,
R.E.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> The scope of the report included New Brunswick,
which was in that year separated from Nova Scotia;
and it is noteworthy that the writer recommended union
of the maritime provinces with Canada, placing the
capital for the united colony in Cape Breton. The
Loyalists in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick or, as
Colonel Morse styled them, the ‘new inhabitants, viz.,
the disbanded troops and Loyalists who came into this
province since the Peace’, were mustered in the summer
of 1784 and were found to number 28,347, including
women, children and servants. Among them were 3,000
negroes, largely from New York. As against these newcomers
there were only 14,000 old British inhabitants,
of whom a great part had been disaffected during the
war owing to their New England connexion. Of the
refugees 9,000 were located on the St. John river, and
nearly 8,000 at the new township of Shelburne in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
south-west corner of Nova Scotia. Morse gave a pitiable
account of the condition of the immigrants at the time
when he wrote. Very few were as yet settled on their
lands; if not fed by the Government they must perish.
‘They have no other country to go to—no other asylum.’
There had been the usual emigration story in the case
of Nova Scotia, supplemented by exceptional circumstances.
Glowing accounts had been circulated of its
attractions as a home and place of refuge. Thousands
who left New York after the Peace had been signed,
and before the port was finally evacuated by the British
troops, went to Nova Scotia, having to find homes
somewhere. Then ensued disappointment, hardship and
deep distress; and the country and its climate were
maligned, as before they had been unduly praised. Nova
Scotia was christened in the United States Nova Scarcity,
and the climate was described as consisting of nine months
winter and three months cold weather.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> In the end
many of the emigrants drifted off again. Some succumbed
to their troubles; but the strong ones held on, and the
Loyalists made of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
sound and thriving provinces of the British Empire.</p>

<p>In addition to the refugees who have been enumerated
above, some 3,000 settled in Cape Breton Island, others
found homes in the Gaspé peninsula on the Bay of
Chaleurs, others again on the seignory of Sorel at the <span class="sidenote">Loyalist colonization of the province of Ontario.</span>
mouth of the Richelieu river, which Haldimand had
bought for the Crown in 1780<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> and which had a special
value from a military point of view; but more important
was the emigration to Upper Canada and the settlement
of the present province of Ontario. Through the
war the Loyalists had been coming in from the revolting
states, many of them on arrival in Canada taking service
for the Crown in the provincial regiments. When peace
came, more arrived and, with the disbanded soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
became colonists of Canada. In July, 1783, an additional
Royal Instruction was given to Haldimand to allot lands
to such of the ‘inhabitants of the colonies and provinces,
now in the United States of America’, as were ‘desirous
of retaining their allegiance to us and of living in our
dominions and for this purpose are disposed to take
up and improve lands in our province of Quebec’, and
also to such non-commissioned officers and privates as
might be disbanded in the province and be inclined to
become settlers in it. The lands were to be divided into
distinct seignories or fiefs, in each seignory a glebe was to be
reserved, and every recipient of land was to make a declaration
to the effect that ‘I will maintain and defend to the
utmost of my power the authority of the King in his Parliament
as the supreme legislature of this province’.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> Along
the St. Lawrence from Lake St. Francis upwards; in the
neighbourhood of Cataraqui or Fort Frontenac, near the
outlet of Lake Ontario, where the name of Kingston
tells its own tale; on the Bay of Quinté in Lake Ontario;
near the Niagara river; and over against Detroit, the
Loyalists were settled. The strength of the settlements
was shown by the fact that by the Imperial Act of
1791 Upper Canada was constituted a separate province.
About that date there seem to have been some 25,000
white inhabitants in Upper Canada, but the number of
Loyalists who came into the province before or immediately
after the Peace was much smaller.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> It is impossible
to give even the roughest estimate of the total number
of emigrants from the United States in consequence of
the war, or even of the total number of Loyalist settlers
in British North America. A census report estimates
that in all about 40,000 Loyalists took refuge in British<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
North America.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Mr. Kingsford<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> thinks that the original
emigration to the British American provinces did not
exceed 45,000; a modern American writer<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> places the
number of those who came to Canada and the Maritime
Provinces within the few years before and succeeding
the Peace at 60,000. Whatever were their numbers,
the refugees from the United States leavened the whole
history of the Dominion; and from the date of their
arrival Canada entered on a new era of her history and
made a long step forward to becoming a nation.</p>

<p>The British Government and the nation on the whole did
their duty by the Loyalists in Canada. They gave money,
they gave lands, they gave food and clothing, and they
gave them a title of honour. At a council meeting held
at Quebec on the 9th of November, 1789, Lord Dorchester
said that it was his wish to put a mark of honour upon the
families who had adhered to the unity of the Empire
and joined the Royal Standard in America before the
Treaty of Separation in the year 1783; and it was ordered
that the land boards should keep a registry of them
‘to the end that their posterity may be discriminated
from future settlers’. From that time they were known
as the United Empire Loyalists; and when in the year <span class="sidenote">The United Empire Loyalists.</span>
1884 the centenary of their arrival in Canada was kept,
the celebration showed that the memory of their sufferings
and of their loyalty was still cherished, that their descendants
still rightfully claimed distinction as bearing the
names and inheriting the traditions of those who through
good and evil report remained true to the British cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote">American
persecution
of the
Loyalists
a political
mistake.</div>

<p>In the debate in the House of Commons on the terms
of the Peace, Lord North, speaking of the attitude of
the Americans toward the Loyalists, said, ‘I term it
impolitic, for it will establish their character as a vindictive
people. It would have become the interests as well as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
the character of a newly-created people to have shown
their propensity to compassion’. The record of the treatment
of the Loyalists by their compatriots in the United
States is not the brightest page in American history. The
terrible memory of the border war was not calculated to
make the victorious party lean to the side of compassion
when the fighting was over, but when all allowance has
been made for the bitterness which was the inevitable
result of the long drawn out struggle, the Americans
cannot be said to have shown much good faith or generosity
in their dealings with the Loyalists or much political
wisdom. There were exceptions among them. Men like
Jay and Alexander Hamilton and the partisan leader
in the south, General Marion, gave their influence for
justice and mercy; but on the whole justice and mercy
were sadly wanting. The newly-created people, as Lord
North styled the Americans, did not show themselves
wise in their generation. Their policy towards the Loyalists
was not that of men confident in the strength and the
righteousness of their cause; nor, if they wished to
drive the English out of America and, as Franklin tried
in his dealings with Oswald, to secure Canada for the
United States, did they take the right course to achieve
their end. This point is forcibly put by the American
writer Sabine, whose book published in 1847 is not
wanting in strong patriotic bias. He shows how British
colonization in Canada and Nova Scotia was the direct
result of the persecution of the Loyalists, and sums up
that ‘humanity to the adherents of the Crown and prudent
regard for our own interests required a general amnesty’.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
The Americans, for their own future, would have done
well to conciliate rather than to punish, to retain citizens
by friendly treatment not to force them into exile. Their
policy bore its inevitable fruit, and the most determined
opponents of the United States in after years were the
men and the children of the men who were driven out
and took refuge in Canada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Reasons
for the
persecution
of the
Loyalists.</div>

<p>The policy was unwise, but it was intelligible; and it
is the more intelligible when viewed in the light of the
contrast furnished by the sequel to the great civil war
between the Northern and the Southern states. As time
goes on and the world becomes more civilized, public
and private vendettas tend to go out of fashion and
individuals and nations alike find it a little easier to
forgive, though possibly not to forget. In any case,
therefore, the outcome of a war eighty years later than
the American War of Independence might have been <span class="sidenote">The American War of Independence as contrasted with the later war between the North and the South.</span>
expected to bear traces of kindlier feeling and broader
humanity. But there were other reasons for the contrast
between the attitude taken up by the victorious Northern
states towards the defeated Southern confederacy and
that of the successful Revolutionary party towards their
Loyalist opponents. The cause for which the Northerners
fought and conquered was the maintenance of the Union;
the cause for which the partisans of the Revolution
fought and conquered was separation. It was therefore
logical and consistent, when the fighting was over, in
the former case to do what could be done to cement the
Union, in the latter to do all that would accentuate
and complete separation. Amnesty was in a sense the
natural outcome of the later war, proscription was in
a sense the natural outcome of the earlier. Slowly
and reluctantly the revolting states came to the determination
to part company with the mother country.
Having made their decision and staked their all upon
carrying it to a successful issue, they were minded also to
part company for all time with those among them who
held the contrary view. They were a new people, not
wholly sure of their ground; they would not run the
risk, as it seemed, of trying to reconcile men whose
hearts were not with theirs.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in contrasting the two wars it will be
noted that in the later there was a geographical division
between the two parties which did not exist in the earlier
case. The great civil war was a fight between North and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
South; there was not fighting in each single state of
the Union. The result, broadly speaking, was a definite
conquest of a large and well-defined area where the
feeling had been solidly hostile, and the only practical
method of permanently retaining the conquered states
was by amnesty and reconciliation. The War of Independence,
as already pointed out, was not thus geographically
defined. In each separate state there was civil
war, local, narrow, and bitter; and, when the end came,
the solution most congenial to the victorious majority
in each small community was also a practicable though
not a wise or humane solution, viz., to weed out the
malcontents and to make good the Patriots’ losses at
the expense of the Loyalists. Union was accepted by
the thirteen states as a necessity; it was not the principle
for which they contended. They fought for separation,
they jealously retained all they could of their local
independence, and each within its own limits carried
out the principle of separation to its bitter end by proscribing
the adherents to the only Union which they had
known before the war, that which was produced by
common allegiance to the British Crown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Glengarry
settlers.</div>

<p>The main result of the incoming of the Loyalists was
to give to Canada a Protestant British population by
the side of a Roman Catholic French community; but
among the immigrants were Scottish Highlanders from the
back settlements of the province of New York, Gaelic
speaking and Roman Catholic in religion, who had
served in the war and who were very wisely settled in
what is now Glengarry county on the edge of the French
Canadian districts. Here their religion was a bond
between them and the French Canadians, while their
race and traditions kept them in line with the other
British settlers of Ontario. They brought with them
the honoured name of Macdonell, and in the early years
of the nineteenth century another body of Macdonells,
also disbanded soldiers, joined them from the old country.
It needs no telling how high the record of the Macdonells<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
stands in the annals of Canada, or how the Glengarry
settlers proved their loyalty and their worth in the war
of 1812.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Scheme
for a
settlement
of
French
Royalists
in Upper
Canada.</div>

<p>Side by side with this Macdonell immigration, may
be noted an abortive immigration scheme for Upper
Canada, which was not British and was later in time
than the War of American Independence, but which had
something in common with the advent of the Loyalists.
This was an attempt to form a French Royalist settlement
in Upper Canada under Count Joseph de Puisaye, ‘ci
devant Puisaye the much enduring man and Royalist’,<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
a French <i>emigré</i> who had taken a leading part in the
disastrous landing at Quiberon Bay in 1795. In or about
1797 he seems to have made a proposal to the British
Government that they should send out a number of the
Royalist refugees to Canada. The projected settlement
was to be on military and feudal lines. ‘The same
measure must be employed as in founding the old colony
of Canada.... It was the soldiery who cleared
and prepared the land for our French settlements of
Canada and Louisiana.’ The writer of the above had
evidently in mind the measures taken in the days of
Louis XIV to colonize New France, and the planting
out of the Carignan-Salières Regiment.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> The scheme,
it was anticipated, would commend itself to the Canadians
in view of the community of race, language and religion,
while to the British Government its value would consist
in placing ‘decided Royalists in a country where republican
principles and republican customs are becoming
leading features’, i. e. on the frontiers of the United States.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
In July, 1798, the Duke of Portland wrote to the Administrator
of Upper Canada on the subject, evidently contemplating
the possibility of a considerable emigration to
Canada of French refugees then living in England, of
whom de Puisaye and about forty others, who were to
embark in the course of the summer, would be the forerunners.
The Duke laid down that de Puisaye and
his company were to be treated as American Loyalists
in the matter of allotment of land. William Windham,
Pitt’s Secretary for War, also wrote, introducing de
Puisaye to the Administrator as being personally well-known
to himself, and explaining that the object of the
scheme was ‘to provide an asylum for as many as possible
of those whose adherence to the ancient laws, religion,
and constitution of their country has rendered them
sacrifices to the French Revolution’, to select by preference
those who had served in the Royalist armies, to allow
them to have a settlement of their own ‘as much as
possible separate from any other body of French, or of
those persons speaking French, who may be at present
in America, or whom Government may hereafter be
disposed to settle there’, and by this comparative isolation,
as well as by giving them some element of military
and feudal discipline, to preserve to them the character
‘of a society founded on the principles of reverence for
religion and attachment to monarchy’. The scheme
was born out of due time. The coming century and the
New World were not the time and place for reviving
feudal institutions. But on paper it was an attractive
scheme. Side by side with the British Loyalists who
had been driven out of the newly-formed American
republic, would be settled French Loyalists whom the
Revolution had hunted from France. Their loyalty
and their sufferings for their cause would commend them
to their British fellow colonists: their kinship in race,
religion, and language would commend them to the French
Canadians, who in turn had little sympathy with a France
that knew not Church or King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span></p>

<p>The place selected for the settlement was between
Toronto and Lake Simcoe. It was chosen as being
roughly equidistant from the French settlements in
Lower Canada and those on the Detroit river, and as
being near the seat of government, Toronto then York,
and consequently within easy reach of assistance and
well under control. Here a township was laid out and
called Windham. De Puisaye and his party arrived at
Montreal in October, 1798, and in the middle of November
de Puisaye himself was at York, while his followers
remained through the winter at Kingston. It was a bad
time of year for starting a new settlement in Upper
Canada, and possibly this was one of the reasons why
it failed from the first. Another was that de Puisaye,
who seems to have formed a friendship with Joseph
Brant,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> divided the small band of emigrants and went
off himself to form a second settlement on or near the
Niagara river. The scheme in short never took root:
the emigrants or most of them went elsewhere; the name
Windham went elsewhere and is now to be found in
Norfolk county of Ontario. De Puisaye went back to
London after the Peace of Amiens, and the project for
a French Royalist colony in Upper Canada passed into
oblivion.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<p>White Loyalists were not the only residents within the
present boundaries of the United States who expatriated
themselves or were expatriated in consequence of the
War of Independence, and who settled in Canada. It
has been seen that the Six Nation Indians had in the <span class="sidenote">Loyalty of the Six Nation Indians and their settlement in Canada.</span>
main been steadily on the British side throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
war, and that prominent among them were the Mohawks
led by Joseph Brant. When peace was signed containing
no recognition or safeguard of the country of the Six
Nations or of native rights, the Indians complained
with some reason that their interests had been sacrificed
by Great Britain. Under these circumstances Governor
Haldimand offered them lands on the British side of
the lakes; and a number of them—more especially the
Mohawks—permanently changed their dwelling-place
still to remain under their great father, the King of
England.</p>

<p>There were two principal settlements. One was on the
Bay of Quinté, west of Kingston, where some of the
Mohawks took up land side by side with the disbanded
Rangers, in whose company they had fought in the war,
and where the township Tyendenaga recalled the Indian
name of Brant. A larger and more important settlement
was on the Grand river, also called Ours or Ouse, flowing
into Lake Erie due west of the Niagara river. Here
Haldimand, by a proclamation dated the 25th of October,
1784, found homes for these old allies of England, the
land or part of it having, by an agreement concluded
in the previous May, been bought for the purpose from
the Mississauga Indians. The proclamation set forth
that His Majesty had been pleased to direct that, ‘in consideration
of the early attachment to his cause manifested
by the Mohawk Indians, and of the loss of their settlement
which they thereby sustained, a convenient tract
of land under his protection should be chosen as a safe
and comfortable retreat for them and others of the Six
Nations who have either lost their settlements within
the territory of the American states or wish to retire
from them to the British;’ and that therefore, ‘at the
desire of many of these His Majesty’s faithful allies’,
a tract of land had been purchased from the Indians
between the Lakes Ontario, Huron and Erie, possession
of which was authorized to the Mohawk nation and
such other of the Six Nation Indians as wished to settle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
in that quarter, for them and their posterity to enjoy
for ever.</p>

<p>The lands allotted were defined in the proclamation
as ‘six miles deep from each side of the river, beginning
at Lake Erie and extending in that proportion to the
head of the said river’. Here, in the present counties
of Brant and Haldimand, many tribesmen of the Six
Nations settled. Brant county and its principal town
Brantford recall the memory of the Mohawk leader,
and such villages as Cayuga, Oneida, and Onondaga
testify that other members of the old confederacy, in
addition to the Mohawks, crossed over to British soil.
Within a few years difficulties arose as to the intent of
the grant, the Indians, headed by Brant, wishing to sell
some of the lands; a further and more formal document,
issued by Governor Simcoe in 1793, did not settle the
question; and eventually a large part of the area included
in the original grant was parted with for money payments
which were invested for the benefit of the Indians. A
report made in July, 1828, and included in a Parliamentary
Blue Book of 1834<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>, stated that the number of the Indian
settlers on the Grand river was at that date under 2,000
souls: that ‘they are now considered as having retained
about 260,000 acres of land, mostly of the best quality.
Their possessions were formerly more extensive, but
large tracts have been sold by them with the permission
of H. M.’s Government, the moneys arising from which
sales were either funded in England or lent on interest
in this country. The proceeds amount to about £1,500
p.a.’.</p>

<p>Thus a large number of the Six Nation Indians adhered
to the English connexion and left their old homes for ever:
most of them became members of the Church of England,
and the first church built in the Province of Ontario is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
said to have been one for the Mohawks.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> In the second
American war, as in the first, they remained faithful
as subjects and allies; and to this day the descendants
of the once formidable confederacy hold fast to the old-time
covenant which their forefathers made with the
English King.</p>

<span class="fs80">LORD DORCHESTER AND THE CANADA ACT OF
1791</span></h2>

<p>Sir Frederick Haldimand, who had succeeded
Carleton and had governed Canada with conspicuous
ability during the later years of the American War of
Independence, left on the 15th of November, 1784. After <span class="sidenote">Carleton’s second term as Governor of Canada.</span>
an interval of nearly two years Carleton succeeded him.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a>
Carleton had been Commander-in-Chief at New York from
May, 1782, till November, 1783, refusing to evacuate the
city until he had provided for the safe transport of the large
number of Loyalists who wished to leave. In April, 1786,
he was appointed for the second time Governor of Canada.
He was created Lord Dorchester in the following August,
and he arrived at Quebec on the 23rd of October in the
same year, being then sixty-two years of age. He remained
in Canada till August, 1791, when he took leave
of absence until September, 1793, and he finally left in
July, 1796. The whole term of his second government
thus lasted for ten years. During his first government
he had been Governor of the province of Quebec alone,
but in April, 1786, he was appointed ‘Captain-General and
Governor-in-Chief’ not only of the province of Quebec—the
boundaries of that province being now modified by
the terms of the Peace of 1783—but also of Nova Scotia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span><a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
and of the newly-created province of New Brunswick,
receiving three separate commissions in respect of the
three separate provinces. Thus he was, or was intended
to be, in the fullest sense Governor-General of British
North America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">House of
Commons
debate
on Carleton’s
pension.</div>

<p>Before he went out, a debate in the House of Commons,
towards the end of June, 1786, gave evidence of the high
repute in which he was held. William Pitt, Prime
Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer, presented
a Royal Message, asking the House, in consideration
of Carleton’s public services, to enable His Majesty to
confer a pension of £1,000 per annum upon Carleton’s
wife, Lady Maria Carleton, and upon his two sons for their
several lives. The pension, it was explained, had been
promised by the King in 1776, but partly by accident
and partly by Carleton’s own wish the grant had been
postponed. It was recounted by one of the speakers
that ‘when all our other colonies had revolted, he
(Carleton) by his gallantry, activity, and industry saved
the city of Quebec, and by that means the whole province
of Canada’; and when one malcontent—the only one—Courtenay
by name, denied that Carleton had rendered
any services, asserting with wonderful hardihood, that
‘Sir Guy had by no means protected Quebec. It was
the inhabitants in conjunction with Chief Justice Livius
(whom General Carleton afterwards expelled from his
situation) that protected it’, another member, Captain
Luttrell, rejoined that ‘In the most brilliant war we
ever sustained, he was foremost in the most hard earned
victories, and in the most disgraceful contest in which
we ever were engaged, he alone of all our generals was
unconquered’. But the most delightful tribute to
Carleton was paid by Burgoyne, when the resolution
had been agreed to and was being reported. Referring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
to the help which Carleton had given him in his fateful
expedition, he said ‘Had Sir Guy been personally employed
in that important command, he could not have fitted
it out with more assiduity, more liberality, more zeal,
than disappointed, displeased, and resentful against the
King’s servants, he employed to prepare it for a junior
officer’. Burgoyne then went on to testify to the uprightness
of Carleton’s administration, ‘the purity of hand
and heart with which he had always administered the
expenditure of the public purse.’ The pension was
sanctioned unanimously, to date from the 1st of January,
1785.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Population
of
Canada
in 1784.</div>

<p>In 1784, before the full tale of Loyalist immigration
was yet complete, Canada, including the three districts
of Quebec, Three Rivers, and Montreal, had a population
of 113,000,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> the towns of Quebec and Montreal containing
in either case between 6,000 and 7,000 residents. This
was really the population of what was afterwards the
province of Lower Canada, exclusive of Ontario and the
Maritime Provinces which were the main scenes of
Loyalist settlement. The overwhelming majority of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
population in the province of Quebec, as Canada, other
than the Maritime Provinces, was styled prior to the Act
of 1791, consisted of French Canadians, and the citizens
of British birth were still comparatively few in number:
but, as has been seen, the incoming of British citizens
was actively in process under Haldimand’s administration;
and during the same administration a beginning was <span class="sidenote">The first canals in Canada.</span>
made of the canals which have played so great a part in
the history of Eastern Canada. Between the years 1779
and 1783, mainly for military reasons, Royal Engineers
under Haldimand’s directions constructed canals with
locks round the rapids between Lake St. Francis and
Lake St. Louis above Montreal, and in 1785 proposals
were first made—though not at the time carried into
effect—for a canal to rectify the break in navigation
on the Richelieu river, caused by the rapids between
St. John’s and Chambly, and so to give unimpeded water-communication
between Lake Champlain and the St.
Lawrence. This latter project was of great importance
to Vermont, which had not yet been admitted as a state
to the American Union.</p>

<p>Thus Dorchester came back to the land of the St.
Lawrence and the great lakes amid indications of a new
era with wider developments and corresponding difficulties.
He came back as the man who had saved Canada
in war, had given to the French Canadians the Quebec
Act, and had stood firm at New York for protection of
the Loyalists.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
political
situation
in 1786.</div>

<p>It was not an easy time for any man, however popular,
who was responsible for the security and the welfare of
Canada. British garrisons still held the frontier posts
which, by the Treaty of 1783, Great Britain was bound
to hand over to the United States, viz., Detroit, Michillimackinac,
Erie or Presque Isle, Niagara, Oswego, Oswegatchie,
and, on Lake Champlain, Point au Fer and
Dutchman’s Point. The Indians were at open war with
the Americans down to the year 1794, claiming as their
own the lands to the north of the Ohio; and they were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
embittered against the English, because no provision had
been made in the treaty to safeguard their rights, their
homes and their hunting grounds. The Americans in
their turn were irritated by the withholding of the forts,
and suspected the English of instigating Indian hostilities
and encouraging Indian claims. Meanwhile the internal
affairs of Canada were rapidly growing more complicated,
and the constitutional question pressed for solution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord
Dorchester
on the
Quebec
Act.</div>

<p>Writing on the 13th of June, 1787, to Thomas Townshend,
Lord Sydney, who was then Secretary of State,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> Lord
Dorchester pointed out that the Quebec Act had been
introduced at a time when nothing could be thought of
in Canada but self-defence. It came into force at the
outbreak of the war, and the first Council held under its
provisions was overshadowed by American invasion.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
The Act, therefore, owing to circumstances, had never
really been given a fair trial; yet it may be questioned
whether the very great difficulty of adjusting conflicting
interests in Canada, of bringing the old and the new
into harmony, and of devising a system of government,
which would ensure comparative contentment at the
time and give facilities for future development, was
really increased by the fact that wars and threats and
rumours of wars clouded the first half century of the history
of Canada as a British possession. The evil of distracting
attention from internal problems, of interrupting and
foreshortening political and social reforms was counterbalanced
by the wholesome influence of common danger.
As the removal of that influence had led to the severance
of the old North American colonies from Great Britain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
so the actual or possible hostility of the United States made
the task of holding Canada together easier than it would
otherwise have been, and, by preventing constitutional
questions from absorbing the whole energies of the
government and the public, tended to produce slow and
gradual changes in lieu of reforms so complete as possibly
to amount to revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Petition
for a free
constitution.</div>

<p>On the 24th of November, 1784, immediately after
Haldimand’s departure, a petition for a free constitution
was addressed to the King by his ‘ancient and new
subjects, inhabitants of the province of Quebec’. The
petitioners asked, among other points, for a House of
Representatives or Assembly, with power to impose taxes
to cover the expense of civil government; for a Council
of not less than 30 members, without whose advice no
officer should be suspended and no new office be created
by the governor; for a continuance of the criminal law
of England, and of the ancient laws of the country as to
landed estates, marriage settlements and inheritances; for
the introduction of the commercial laws of England; and
for the embodiment in the constitution of the Habeas
Corpus Act. It will be remembered that an ordinance
had lately been passed by the Legislative Council, on the
29th of April, 1784, ‘For securing the liberty of the
subject and for the prevention of imprisonments out of
this province,’<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> but the petitioners wished to have the
right of Habeas Corpus laid down as a fundamental rule
of the constitution. The petition purported to be from
the ‘New Subjects’, i. e. the French Canadians, as well
as from those of British extraction; but among the signatories
hardly any French Canadian names appeared, and
a counter petition was signed by French Canadian seigniors <span class="sidenote">Counter petition from French Canadian seigniors.</span>
and others, deprecating the proposed change in the
system of government. ‘This plan’, they wrote, ‘is so
much more questionable, as it appears to us to aim at
innovations entirely opposed to the rights of the King
and of his Government and to detach the people from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
submission they have always shown to their Sovereign.’
In April, 1785, a petition was presented in London by <span class="sidenote">Petition from disbanded Loyalist soldiers for a separate province.</span>
Sir John Johnson on behalf of the disbanded soldiers
and other Loyalists settled above Montreal, asking for
the creation of a new district separate from the province
of Quebec, whose capital should be Cataraqui, now
Kingston, and that ‘the blessings of the British laws
and of the British Government, and an exemption from
the (French) tenures, may be extended to the aforesaid
settlements’.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<p>On the 28th of April, 1786, Mr. Powys, a private member
of the House of Commons called attention in the House <span class="sidenote">Debate on Mr. Powys’ Bill in the House of Commons April, 1786.</span>
to the petition of 1784;<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> and, in view of the fact that
two years had passed since it was presented, and that the
Government had taken no action upon it, he moved for
permission to bring in a Bill to amend the Quebec Act
and ‘for the better securing the liberties of His Majesty’s
subjects in the province of Quebec in North America’.
The object of the Bill, which had been drafted in the
previous year, was to limit the power of the governor,
for the mover complained that the Quebec Act had
‘established as complete a system of despotism as ever
was instituted’, and stated that the aim of his measure
was ‘to give the inhabitants of the province of Quebec
a system of government in the particulars he had mentioned,
founded on known and definitive law. At present
the government of that province rested altogether on
unfixed laws, and was a state of despotism and slavery’.
The Bill purported to give to the Canadians in the fullest
measure the right of Habeas Corpus, except in case of rebellion
or of foreign invasion, when it might be suspended,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
but only for three months at a time, and only by ordinance
of the Legislative Council; to give trial by jury
in civil cases at the option of either of the parties; to
take from the governor the power of committing to prison
by his own warrant, and of suspending judges and members
of the Legislative Council; while the last clause increased
the numbers of the council. It was supported by Fox,
who took the opportunity to denounce the Quebec Act
‘as a Bill founded upon a system of despotism’, and by
Sheridan; but the majority in a very thin House rejected
it, agreeing with Pitt that, in view of the contradictory
petitions which came from Canada, it would be well
to wait until Carleton went out and reported upon the
feeling of the country.</p>

<p>Petitions continued to come in. In June, 1787, Lord
Dorchester wrote to Lord Sydney that with the increase
of the English population the desire for an Assembly
would increase, but that he himself was at a loss for a
plan, and that a more pressing matter was a change in
the tenure of land. In the following September Lord
Sydney replied, in somewhat similar terms, that there
was no present intention to alter the constitution, but
that the King would be advised to make a change in
the system of land tenure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Adam
Lymburner
heard
before the
House
of Commons.</div>

<p>In 1788 Adam Lymburner, a merchant of good position
in Quebec, was sent as a delegate to London, to represent
the views of the British minority in the province; and
on Friday, the 16th of May, 1788, he was heard at the bar
of the House of Commons, in support of the petitions
which had been presented. He called attention mainly
to the confused state of the law in Canada, and to the
defects and anomalies in the administration of justice.
A debate followed on a motion by Mr. Powys<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> to the effect
that the petitions deserved the immediate and serious consideration
of Parliament. The mover once more attacked
the Quebec Act of 1774, characterizing it ‘as a rash and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
fatal’ measure and, when challenged to state what he
considered to be the points of greatest urgency, specified
‘the rendering the writ of Habeas Corpus a matter of
right, the granting independence to the judges, the lessening
of the servility and dependence of the superior officers
of justice, and the establishing a House of Assembly’.
Fox, Sheridan and Burke spoke as usual against the <span class="sidenote">Fox and Burke on the Quebec Act.</span>
Government, denouncing Pitt for pleading that, in view
of the divergent views held in Canada, the Government
should be given more time to obtain further information
from Lord Dorchester. The whole of Lord Dorchester’s
evidence on the Quebec Bill, said Fox, who professed
great respect for Lord Dorchester himself, ‘contained
opinions wholly foreign to the spirit and uncongenial
with the nature of the English constitution. Lord Dorchester,
therefore, was the last man living whose opinion
he would wish to receive upon the subject.’ Burke spoke
of the Quebec Act as ‘a measure dealt out by this country
in its anger under the impulse of a passion that ill-suited
the purposes of wise legislation’.</p>

<p>It was true that two years had passed since the previous
discussion on the subject in the House of Commons,
and that nothing had been done in the meantime; but
the hollowness of the debate was shown by the stress
laid by the Opposition speakers on the subject of Habeas
Corpus. The recently passed ordinance had given to
Canadians the right of Habeas Corpus, but it was argued
that the grant was temporary only and that the Crown
which had given the right and confirmed the ordinance
might take it away, whereas no time should be lost in
providing that Canadians, like all other British subjects,
should enjoy it ‘as a matter of right and not as a grant
at the will of the Crown’. There was little evidence
among the speakers that they either knew or cared for
the wishes of the great majority of Canadians, those of
French descent: no suspicion seems to have entered
into their minds that institutions which suited Englishmen
might not be the best in the world for men who were not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
of English birth: it was assumed that clever speakers in
the House of Commons were better judges of the requirements
of a distant British possession than the man on
the spot with unrivalled knowledge of local conditions.
The debate well illustrated the prejudice and half knowledge
with which partisan legislators in England approach
colonial problems, and it afforded a good explanation
of the grounds on which the common sense of England
let the brilliant debaters talk harmlessly in opposition
and entrusted the real work of the country to William
Pitt. It ended in a motion, agreed to by the Prime
Minister, that the House would take the subject into their
earnest consideration early next session.</p>

<p>Following on the debate, Sydney wrote to Dorchester
on the 3rd of September, asking for the fullest possible
information before the next discussion should take place,
and intimating that a division of the province was
contemplated. On the 8th of November in the same
year, Lord Dorchester replied, giving his views on the <span class="sidenote">Lord Dorchester’s views opposed to division of the province.</span>
political situation. In the districts of Quebec and
Montreal, exclusive of the towns, he estimated the
proportion of British residents to French Canadians as
one to forty; including the towns, as one to fifteen;
and including the Loyalist settlements above Montreal,
as one to five. The demand for an Assembly, he considered,
came from the commercial classes, that is to say,
from the towns where the British were most numerous:
the seigniors and country gentlemen were opposed to it,
the clergy were neutral, the uneducated habitants would
be led by others. His own opinion was that a division
of the province was at present unadvisable; but, should
a division be decided upon, there was no reason why
the western districts should not have an Assembly and
so much of the English system of laws as suited their
local circumstances, care being taken to secure the
property and civil rights of the French Canadian settlers
in the neighbourhood of Detroit, who had increased in
numbers owing to the fur trade. A year later, on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
20th of October, 1789, he was informed by Grenville,
who had succeeded Sydney as Secretary of State, that
the Government had decided to alter the constitution
of Canada and to divide the province of Quebec, a draft
of the Bill which was to be introduced into Parliament <span class="sidenote">Outline of the Canada Act.</span>
for the purpose being enclosed for an expression of the
governor’s views, with blank spaces to be filled up on
receiving from him information as to certain points of
detail.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Difficulties
of the
situation.</div>

<p>Curiously complex were the conditions which the Bill
was intended to meet. Assuming that the population
of Canada had been homogeneous and of British descent,
and assuming that Canada had been a single, well-defined
colony, so that no question of subdivision could arise,
it would still have remained a most difficult problem to
decide within what limits political representation should
be given and how far it should involve responsibility
and real self-government. The British demand in Canada
was for institutions to which Englishmen had always
been accustomed, and which the old North American
colonies of Great Britain had enjoyed. The petition of
November, 1784, showed that the demand included right
of taxation and a certain control over the Executive.
This last point seems subsequently not to have been
pressed, though it involved the essence of self-government,
had been prominent in the disputes between the
old colonies and the mother country, and had been
emphasized in Canada by the fact that on the one hand
the Home Government had conspicuously misused its
patronage in making appointments in Canada, and that
on the other, two strong governors, Carleton and Haldimand,
in time of war and in face of disloyalty, had not
hesitated so to put forth their strength as to incur the
charge of being arbitrary.</p>

<p>But the population of Canada was not homogeneous,
and the colony was obviously not one and indivisible.
Even among the English residents there was diversity of
interest. Those who lived in the districts of Quebec and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
Montreal, and for whom Lymburner spoke, were opposed
to a division of the province, because the main body of
subjects of English birth was to be found in the new
settlements in Upper Canada. These newcomers, on the
contrary, had much to gain by being severed from French
Canada and incorporated into a separate colony. The
British minority again in the old province contended
that half the number of the representatives to be elected
should be assigned to the towns where the number and
the influence of the English residents was greatest,
Quebec and Montreal containing at the time one Englishman
to every two Canadians; thus town and country
interests were pitted against each other. Meanwhile the
overwhelming majority of the population, the French
Canadians, set little store by the representative institutions
which the English desired to enjoy. They had never
known them and therefore never valued them, and they
had reason to fear that any change might tend to give
more power to the English minority accustomed to a
political machinery which was novel to themselves.
The habitants thought only whether their taxes would
be increased, and whether new laws and customs would
be substituted for those which they understood; the
seigniors dreaded losing their feudal rights; the priests
their privileges and authority. There was a very strong
element of conservatism in French Canada running
counter to the demand for political reform, and even
in Upper Canada, in the district over against Detroit,
and at some other points, there was a small minority of
French settlers whose interests, as Dorchester had pointed
out, could not be overlooked.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
question
of land
tenure.</div>

<p>Almost as important and fully as pressing as the
question of political representation was that of land
tenure. Was the land system of the future, especially
in Upper Canada, to be the cumbrous feudal tenure which
Louis XIV had imported from the Old to the New World?
or was it to be assimilated to the land laws of England?
Were other laws too, and was the legal procedure,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
especially in commercial matters, to be on French or
English lines? Partly through confusion as to what was
the law of the land, and partly because such judicial
appointments as that of Livius were not calculated to
inspire respect for the personnel of the judges, the administration
of justice in Canada at this time had been hotly
assailed, and a long local inquiry into the subject began
in 1787, but seems to have produced little or no result in
consequence of the passing of the Canada Act.</p>

<p>When there were so many difficulties to be faced and
met, it was fortunate that the thorny questions of
language and religion were not added to the number.
The religious question had been settled by the Quebec
Act, and all that was required was to make definite
provision for the Protestant clergy, while not interfering
with the rights which had been confirmed to the Roman
Catholic priesthood. As to language, for good or for
evil, no attempt seems to have been made by the Imperial
Government to substitute English for French; the oaths
prescribed by the terms of the 1791 Act were to be administered
either in English or in French as the case might
require, and the first elected Assembly of Lower Canada
agreed not to give to either tongue preference over the
other.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Grenville’s
dispatch
and
letter.</div>

<p>The terms of Grenville’s dispatch to Dorchester of the
20th October, 1789, in which he enclosed the draft of
the proposed Act, and of the Private and Secret letter
which he wrote at the same time, are interesting as showing
the grounds on which Pitt’s Government had come
to the decision to divide Canada into two provinces and
to give popular institutions in either case.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> Grenville<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
wrote that the general object of the plan adopted by the
Government was to assimilate the constitution of the
province of Quebec to that of Great Britain ‘as nearly
as the difference arising from the manners of the people <span class="sidenote">Arguments for a division into two provinces</span>
and from the present situation of the province will admit’.
In trying to effect this object it was necessary to pay
attention to the ‘prejudices and habits of the French
inhabitants’, and most carefully to safeguard the civil
and religious rights which had been secured to them
at or subsequently to the capitulation of the province.
This consideration had largely influenced the Government
in favour of dividing the province into two districts, still to
remain under the administration of a Governor-General,
but each to have a Lieutenant-Governor and separate
Legislature. The Government, Grenville continued, had <span class="sidenote">based upon the grant of representative institutions.</span>
not overlooked the reasons urged by Lord Dorchester
against a division of the province, and they felt that
great weight would have been due to his suggestions,
had it been intended to continue the existing form of
administration and not to introduce representative institutions;
but, the decision having been taken to establish
a provincial legislature to be chosen in part by the people,
‘every consideration of policy seemed to render it desirable
that the great preponderance possessed in the upper
districts by the King’s ancient subjects, and in the
lower by the French Canadians, should have their effect
and operation in separate legislatures, rather than that
these two bodies of people should be blended together
in the first formation of the new constitution, and before
sufficient time has been allowed for the removal of ancient
prejudices by the habit of obedience to the same government
and by the sense of a common interest’. Grenville’s
private letter, which supplemented the public dispatch,
showed that a lesson had been learnt from the late war<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
with the American colonies. ‘I am persuaded,’ he
wrote, ‘that it is a point of true policy to make these
concessions at a time when they may be received as
a matter of favour, and when it is in our own power to
regulate and direct the manner of applying them, rather
than to wait till they shall be extorted from us by a
necessity which shall neither leave us any discretion in
the form nor any merit in the substance of what we
give.’<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> The last paragraph of the letter gave another
reason for making the proposed changes without further
delay, and that was that ‘the state of France is such as
gives us little to fear from that quarter in the present
moment. The opportunity is therefore most favourable
for the adoption of such measures as may tend to consolidate
our strength, and increase our resources, so as
to enable ourselves to meet any efforts that the most
favourable event of the present troubles can ever enable
her to make’. The letter was written after the taking
of the Bastille and the outbreak of the French Revolution,
when Lafayette was in demand at home and not likely
to make further excursions into American politics; but
the words implied that France was still in the eyes of
British statesmen the main source of danger to Great
Britain, especially in connexion with Canada, and that
the grant of representative institutions to British and
French colonists in Canada was likely to strengthen the
hands of Great Britain as against her most formidable
rival.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Policy
of the
British
Government
determined
by the
results
of the
War of
American
Independence.</div>

<p>The correspondence shows clearly that the outcome
of the War of American Independence had inclined the
British Government to give popular representation to
the remaining British possessions in North America. On
the other hand there are passages in it which should be
noted, indicating that ministers were anxious at the same
time to introduce certain safeguards against democracy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
which had been wanting in the old North American
colonies. Grenville’s dispatch stated that it was intended
to appoint the members of the Upper Chamber, the
Legislative Council, for life and during good behaviour, <span class="sidenote">Proposed safeguards to the grant of popular institutions.</span>
provided that they resided in the province. It also
stated that it was the King’s intention to confer upon
those whom he nominated to the Council ‘some mark
of honour, such as a Provincial Baronetage, either personal
to themselves or descendible to their eldest sons in lineal <span class="sidenote">Suggestion to give titles to members of the Upper Chamber.</span>
succession’, adding that, if there was in after years a
great growth of wealth in Canada, it might be possible
at some future date to ‘raise the most considerable of
these persons to a higher degree of honour’. The object
of these regulations, he wrote, ‘is both to give to
the Upper Branch of the Legislature a greater degree
of weight and consequence than was possessed by the
Councils in the old colonial governments, and to establish
in the provinces a body of men having that motive of
attachment to the existing form of government which
arises from the possession of personal or hereditary
distinction.’ In writing as above, Grenville did not state
in so many words that the Government contemplated
making appointment to the Legislative council hereditary
in certain cases, but merely that it was proposed to give
some title to certain members of the Council, which title
might be made hereditary; nor was any clause dealing
with the subject included in the draft of the Bill which
was sent to Lord Dorchester. The latter, however, <span class="sidenote">Lord Dorchester opposed to the suggestion.</span>
rightly understood that what Pitt and his colleagues
had in their minds was to give to each of the two provinces,
into which Canada was to be divided, an Upper House
which might develop into a House of Lords; and his
answer was that, while many advantages might result
from a hereditary Legislative Council distinguished by
some mark of honour, if the condition of the country
was such as to support the dignity, ‘the fluctuating state
of property in these provinces would expose all hereditary
honours to fall into disregard.’ He recommended, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
that for the time being the members of the Council
should merely be appointed during life, good behaviour,
and residence in the province.</p>

<p>When the Bill was introduced into Parliament, the
provisions dealing with this subject were chiefly attacked
by Fox, who expressed himself in favour of an elected
council, though with a higher property qualification than
would be required in the case of the Lower House or
Assembly. The clauses were carried in a permissive form,
empowering the King, whenever he thought fit to confer
upon a British subject by Letters Patent under the Great <span class="sidenote">Permissive clauses embodied in the Bill.</span>
Seal of either of the provinces a hereditary title of honour,
to attach to the title at his discretion a hereditary right
to be summoned to the Legislative Council, such right
to be forfeited by the holder for various causes including
continual absence from the province, but to be revived
in favour of the heirs. Nothing came of this attempt
to create a hereditary second chamber in the two provinces
of Upper and Lower Canada: no such aristocracy
was brought into being as when the French King and his
ministers built up the French Canadian community on
a basis analogous to the old feudal system of France;
but, nevertheless, Pitt’s proposals cannot be condemned
as fantastic or unreal. They were honestly designed to
meet a defect which had already been felt in the British
colonies, and which must always be felt in new countries,
the lack of a conservative element in the Legislature and
in the people, the absence of dignity and continuity with
the past, and the want of some balance against raw
and undiluted democracy which has not, as in older
lands, been trained to recognize that the body politic
consists of more than numbers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Executive
Council.</div>

<p>The original draft of the Bill contained no provision
for the appointment of an Executive Council distinct
from the two houses of the Legislature. A clause to
that effect was inserted by Lord Dorchester in the
amended draft which he sent back, but it did not appear
in the Act in its final form; though there is a reference<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
in the Act to ‘such Executive Council as shall be appointed
by His Majesty for the affairs’ of either province; and
one section appointed the governor and Executive Council
in each province a court of civil appeal. In his covering
dispatch Grenville asked Lord Dorchester to state the
number and names of the persons whom he might think
proper to recommend to the King for seats on the Executive
Council, and added that it was not intended to
exclude members of the Legislative Council from the
Executive Council, nor on the other hand to select the
Executive Councillors exclusively from the Legislative
Council. Grenville went on to suggest that it might be
well that some persons should be members of the Executive
Council in both of the two districts or provinces. The
net result was that the Executive was still to remain
wholly independent of the Legislature, or at any rate
of the popular house in the Legislature, and therefore the
main element of self-government was to be withheld.
It was left for Lord Durham, after long years of friction
between the Executive and the Legislature, to emphasize
the necessity of giving to the popular representatives the
control of the Executive, making them thereby responsible
for the good government of the people whom they
represented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Crown
Lands’
funds.</div>

<p>In his secret letter to Dorchester, Grenville referred
to ‘the possibility of making such reservations of land
adjacent to all future grants as may secure to the Crown
a certain and improving revenue—a measure which, if it
had been adopted when the old colonies were first settled,
would have retained them to this hour in obedience and
loyalty’. Crown land funds are not yet wholly extinct
in the British colonies. For instance, in the Bahamas,
side by side with the revenue voted by the local Legislature,
there is a small fund independent of the Legislature
and at the disposal of the Crown alone; but the revenue
derived from the fund is not sufficient to pay the salaries
of the Executive officers, even if it were thought desirable
to apply the money to such a purpose. Barbados, with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
its time-honoured constitution, to which Barbadians are
passionately attached, is a good instance of a colony
possessing representative institutions but not responsible
government. Here there are no Crown funds, and the
salaries of the public officers, from the governor downwards,
are voted by the elected representatives, though
the higher Executive appointments, with some exceptions,
are in the gift and under the control not of the Legislature
but of the Crown. In this and in other instances, where
local conditions, including the fact of an overwhelming
preponderance of coloured men over white, have made
for a compromise, a system, illogical in theory and
unsound in practice, has, by mutual forbearance, continued
to work, though not always without friction.
But on any large scale, and especially where the majority
of the residents in a colony are of European birth, the
position is impossible and can only be defended as a
temporary expedient. Yet, in spite of the War of
American Independence and the lessons which it taught,
the world was not in the days of Pitt old enough for the
British ministry to contemplate colonial self-government
in its full expression. Nor, in truth, were the conditions of
Canada sufficiently advanced to have made the introduction
of responsible government either practicable or desirable.
Hence Grenville cast about for an expedient which might
reduce the probability of a conflict between the Executive
and the Legislature, and sought for it in the establishment
of a fund which would belong to the Crown alone and
be expended by the Crown in paying its officers. If his
policy had been consistently carried out, and an adequate
revenue, not derived from taxation, been secured to the
Crown, the result would have been greatly to strengthen
the independence of the Executive by making the salaries
of the officers independent of the vote of the Assembly.
In the end the bitterness of the struggle for popular
control might have been thereby increased, but in the
meantime the petty squabble year by year over voting
supplies, and the mean withholding of pay from this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
or that officer, because he happened to be unpopular at
the moment, might have disappeared. The constitutional
troubles which subsequently became so acute in Lower
Canada, connected more especially with the attempt to
obtain a Civil List, were due to the fact that the revenues
of the Crown were not sufficient to cover the expenses of
the public service without the aid of votes from the
popular Assembly. It was this constant friction which
had preluded the War of Independence, and this it was
which Grenville hoped to avoid by establishing an
adequate fund in the colony at the disposal of the Crown
alone.</p>

<p>But a wider and more statesmanlike safeguard against
the evils of colonial democracy in the eighteenth century
was proposed in connexion with this Canada Act, though
not by the Imperial Government. The post of Chief <span class="sidenote">Chief Justice Smith.</span>
Justice of Canada, which Livius had held, was now after
a long interregnum filled by the appointment of William
Smith, who had been born in the state of New York,
had been Chief Justice of that state, and, coming to
England with Dorchester after the Peace of 1783, had
been appointed to succeed Livius and had accompanied
the Governor-General out to Canada. Invited by Dorchester <span class="sidenote">His proposals for a general Legislature for the British North American Provinces.</span>
to give his views upon the draft of the Bill
which Grenville had sent out, he embodied them in
a remarkable letter which was forwarded to the Home
Government. The Bill, he thought, greatly improved
‘the old mould of our colonial governments, for even
those called the Royal provinces, to distinguish them
from the proprietary and chartered republics of the
Stuart kings, had essential faults and the same general
tendency’; but he missed in it ‘the expected establishment
to put what remains to Great Britain of her ancient
dominions in North America under one general direction,
for the united interests and safety of every branch of
the Empire’. It was when the old North American
colonies became prosperous that the evils inherent in
their system produced their full effect, and he dreaded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
lest the prosperity which he predicted for the two provinces
of Canada might again in time work ruin, unless
what he considered to be the one main safeguard were
provided from the beginning of constitutional government.
‘Native as I am of one of the old provinces,’ he wrote, ‘and
early in the public service and councils, I trace the late
revolt and rent to a remoter cause than those to which it
is ordinarily ascribed. The truth is that the country had
outgrown its government, and wanted the true remedy
for more than half a century before the rupture commenced....
To expect wisdom and moderation from
near a score of petty parliaments, consisting in effect of
only one of the three necessary branches of a parliament,
must, after the light brought by experience, appear to
have been a very extravagant expectation.... An
American Assembly, quiet in the weakness of their infancy,
could not but discover in their elevation to prosperity,
that themselves were the substance, and the governor
and Board of Council were shadows in their political
frame. All America was thus, at the very outset of the
plantations, abandoned to democracy. And it belonged
to the administrations of the days of our fathers to have
found the cure, in the erection of a power upon the
continent itself, to control all its own little republics,
and create a partner in the legislation of the Empire,
capable of consulting their own safety and the common
welfare.’</p>

<p>Such a power the Chief Justice outlined in ‘Proposed
Additions to the New Canada Bill for a General Government’,
which he enclosed in this noteworthy letter,
prefacing them as clauses ‘to provide still more effectually
for the government, safety, and prosperity of all His
Majesty’s dominions in North America, and firmly to
unite the several branches of the Empire’. Provision
was made in them for a Legislative Council and General
Assembly, which, with the Governor-General, were to
legislate for all or any of ‘His Majesty’s dominions and
the provinces whereof the same do now or may hereafter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
consist in the parts of America to the southward of
Hudson’s Bay and in those seas to the Northward of the
Bermuda or Somers Islands’. So many Legislative
Councillors were to be appointed for each province by
the Crown for life, subject to the conditions attached to
membership of the Legislative Council in either of the
two Canadas by the proposed Act; while the members
of the General Assembly were to be elected by the
provincial Assemblies. The Crown might appoint an
Executive Council, and was to be confirmed in full
Executive authority over all and any of the provinces,
while the acts of the General Legislature were to be subject
to disallowance by the Crown, ‘and the said dominions
and all the provinces into which they may be hereafter
divided shall continue and remain to be governed by the
Crown and Parliament of Great Britain as the supreme
Legislature of the whole British Empire’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chief
Justice
Smith’s
views
supported
by
Lord
Dorchester.</div>

<p>Lord Dorchester forwarded these proposals with a few
words indicating that he was in general sympathy with
the views of the Chief Justice. He wrote of the scheme
of a general government for British North America as
one ‘whereby the united exertions of His Majesty’s
North American provinces may more effectually be
directed to the general interest and to the preservation
of the unity of the Empire’. They were the proposals
of a trained lawyer, of an American colonist of standing
and position who had thrown in his lot with the mother
country as against the revolting colonies, and who
stated in the letter from which passages have been
quoted above, that for more than twenty years, that is
to say through all or nearly all the years of strife with
the colonies, he had held the same view as to the radical
defect in the relations between Great Britain and her
colonies and the remedy which might have been applied
at an earlier date. How far, we may ask, did Chief
Justice Smith truly diagnose the disease, if disease it
was, that had proved fatal to the old British Empire in
North America? How far did he indicate what, if the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
disease had been taken in time, would or might have
been an adequate remedy? and how far did he outline
the Canadian Dominion of later days and anticipate
views which are widely held at the present time as to
the future of the British Empire?</p>

<div class="sidenote">Democracy
in
America
was
coeval
with its
colonization.</div>

<p>It has been attempted to show in a previous chapter
that the spirit of independence in the American colonies,
which in the end was embodied in political severance
from Great Britain, was as old as their origin, and drew
its strength from the fact that they had always been
practically independent. This was the starting-point of
the Chief Justice’s argument. ‘All America,’ in his
words, ‘was, at the very outset of the plantations, abandoned
to democracy’, and the separate colonies which
at the time when he wrote, had been federated into the
United States, were ‘little Republics’. Those little
Republics, according to the ordinary colonial contention,
the mother country had neglected in the weakness of
their infancy, while she had tried to oppress them when
they became prosperous and valuable. Chief Justice
Smith read history differently. According to his view
they were quiet until they had grown to strength, and
then they discovered that the ultimate power of government
rested with themselves and not with the mother
country. The remedy, he thought, should have been <span class="sidenote">It should have been controlled from within, not from without.</span>
found not so much by giving greater power to the
Imperial Government as by establishing in America
itself an authority controlling the separate Assemblies
of the separate states, which body would have been
a ‘Partner in the legislation of the Empire’.</p>

<p>It was no new conception that the states should have
been in some sense federated while still under the British
flag. Various governors, and men like Franklin, had
proposed or contemplated some such measure, in order
to correct the weakness of the separate provinces as against
the common foe in Canada, while Canada belonged to
France, and in order to minimize the difficulties which
the Imperial Government found in dealing with a number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
of separate legislatures at least as jealous of each other
as they were of the Home Government. But the Chief
Justice’s retrospect was based on somewhat different <span class="sidenote">The grounds on which Chief Justice Smith advocated a General Legislature for British North America.</span>
grounds. He would have had a federal legislature in
order to control the provincial legislatures. He would
have corrected democracy in America by, in a sense,
carrying democracy further. He would have nothing of
the maxim <i>divide et impera</i>; but, as democracy was
born on American soil, on American soil he would have
constituted a popular authority wider, wiser, and stronger
than the bodies which represented the single provinces.
It was a very statesmanlike view. He saw that one
leading cause of the rupture between Great Britain and
her colonies had been the pettiness of the American
democracies, the narrowness of provincial politics, the
intensity of democratic feeling cooped up in the small
area of a single colony as in a single Greek city, the
personal bitterness thereby produced in local politicians,
and the obvious semblance of oppression when a great
country like England was dealing with one small state
and another, not with a larger federated whole. A
federal legislature would have exercised home-grown
American control over the American Assemblies; it
would have given a wider and fuller scope to American
democracy, enlarging the views, making the individual
leaders greater and wider in mind; it would have been
the body with which England would have dealt; and
the dealings would have been those of ‘Partners in the
legislation of the Empire’. This was in his mind when
he earnestly recommended that the grant of constitutional
privileges to the Canadian provinces should be
from the first accompanied by the creation of a general
government for British North America, including the
maritime provinces as well as Upper and Lower Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
General
Legislature
contemplated
by Chief
Justice
Smith
would
have been
a subordinate
Legislature.</div>

<p>But, if this general government was to be a partner
in the legislation of the Empire, it was clearly to be, in
the view of the Chief Justice, a subordinate partner.
The last of his proposed additions to the Bill began in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
the following terms: ‘Be it further enacted ... that
nothing in this Act contained shall be interpreted to
derogate from the rights and prerogatives of the Crown
for the due exercise of the Royal and Executive authority
over all or any of the said provinces, or to derogate
from the Legislative sovereignty and supremacy of the
Crown and Parliament of Great Britain.’ In other
words he re-affirmed the principle, which the old colonies
had rejected, that they were subordinated to the Parliament
of the mother country as well as to the Crown;
and he showed clearly in the clause empowering the
Crown to appoint Executive Councils apart from the
Legislature, that the Executive power was to rest not in
British North America but in Great Britain. The
general government of British North America was to be
a partner in the legislation of the Empire, but not in
the Executive, and even in the legislative sphere it
was to take a second place. Theoretically, and to some
small extent practically also, the Dominion Parliament
is still a subordinate partner in legislation, so far as <span class="sidenote">The Chief Justice did not contemplate colonial self-government in its fullest form.</span>
Imperial questions are concerned; but, since the days
of Lord Durham, colonial self-government has included
control of the Executive in the colony. Chief Justice
Smith had therefore not contemplated or foreshadowed
the colonial self-government of the future.</p>

<p>But that he had not done so was not due to want of
statesmanship. He was rather still intent on seeking
after a solution of the problem which later thinkers and
statesmen held to be insoluble. The grant of responsible
government in after times was not so much an act of
constructive wisdom as a wise recognition of what was
at the time impossible. To give to the colonial legislatures
the control of the Executive was to remove them
practically from the control of the mother country, and
thereby to concede to these communities the full right of
self-government. The first corrective of this grant was on
similar lines to those which Chief Justice Smith prescribed,
viz., to federate the self-governing communities in a given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
area, to place their separate legislatures under a general
legislature, and, as the legislatures controlled the Executive,
to limit the provincial executive authorities by a
general executive authority, the control being exercised
from within not from without, and small democracies
being rectified by creating from among themselves a larger
and a stronger democratic body. It still remains for the
wisdom of the coming time to carry the constructive
work further; if human ingenuity can devise a
practical scheme, again to extend the principle of democratic
representation and control; and to constitute
a body which, with the Crown, shall, alike in legislation
and in the sphere of the Executive, make the great self-governing
provinces in the fullest sense partners in the
Empire. In short, the point which it is here wished
to emphasize is that whereas self-government was conceded
not as a solution of the problem but as a final
recognition that the problem was insoluble, men have
come to realize that after all what was intended to be
final was only a necessary preliminary to the possible
attainment of an object, which had been relegated to
the land of dreams and speculations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Act
of 1791.</div>

<p>The views of the Chief Justice were not embodied in
the law which was eventually passed in 1791. Pitt had
pledged himself to deal with the Canadian question in
the session of 1790, but in that year Great Britain was
on the brink of war with Spain, owing to the seizure by
the Spaniards in 1789 of British trading vessels in Nootka
Sound, an inlet of what is now known as Vancouver
Island. The matter was adjusted by the Nootka Sound
Convention of 28th October, 1790, after which Vancouver
began his voyages of survey and discovery along the
Pacific Coast of North America; and, the hands of the
British Government being free, a Royal Message to the
House of Commons, dated the 25th of January, 1791,
announced that it was the King’s intention to divide
the province of Quebec into two provinces to be called
Upper and Lower Canada, whenever His Majesty was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
enabled by Act of Parliament to make the necessary
regulations for the government of the said provinces.
The message further recommended that a permanent
appropriation of lands should be made in the provinces
for the support of a Protestant clergy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings
in
Parliament.</div>

<p>On the 4th of March Pitt introduced the Bill. On the
23rd of March Lymburner was heard at the bar of the
House on behalf of its opponents. He took objections,
among other points, to the division of the province, to
the creation of hereditary Legislative Councillors, to the
small number of members who were to constitute the
Assemblies, and to making the Assemblies septennial
instead of triennial. The passage of the Bill through
Committee in the House of Commons was chiefly remarkable
for the historic quarrel between Burke and Fox on
the subject of the French Revolution which was dragged
into the debate. There was no real opposition to the
measure, though Fox opposed the division of the province,
the hereditary councillors, the small numbers assigned to
the Assemblies, and the large provision made for the
Protestant clergy. The duration of the Assemblies was
reduced from seven years to four, and the number of
members in the Assembly of Lower Canada was raised
from thirty to fifty. Thus amended the Bill was read
a third time in the House of Commons on the 18th of
May, and received the Royal Assent on the following
10th of June, one of its sections providing that it should
take effect before the 31st of December, 1791, and
another that the Councils and Assemblies should be
called together before the 31st of December, 1792. It
had been intended that Dorchester should be present
in London during the passing of the Act, in order to
advise the Government on points of detail, but the
dispatch informing him that the Act had already been
passed crossed him on his way to England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Omissions
from the
Act.</div>

<p>The omissions from the Act are as noteworthy as its
contents. The Bill, both as presented to Parliament
and as finally passed into law, contained no description<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
of the line of division between Upper and Lower Canada, <span class="sidenote">It contained no definition of the boundaries of Upper and Lower Canada.</span>
or of the boundaries of the two provinces. In the draft
which Grenville sent out in 1789 there was a blank space,
in which Dorchester was invited, with the help of his
surveyor-general, to insert a description of the boundaries;
but, wrote Grenville in his covering dispatch, ‘there will
be a considerable difficulty in the mode of describing the
boundary between the district of Upper Canada and the
territories of the United States, as the adhering to the
line mentioned in the treaty with America would exclude
the posts which are still in His Majesty’s possession and
which the infraction of the treaty on the part of America
has induced His Majesty to retain, while, on the other
hand, the including them by express words within the
limits to be established for the province by an Act of the
British Parliament would probably excite a considerable
degree of resentment among the inhabitants of the
United States.’ Grenville accordingly suggested that
the Upper Province might be described by some general
terms such as ‘All the territories, &amp;c., possessed by and
subject to His Majesty and being to the West or South
of the boundary line of Lower Canada, except such as
are included within the present boundaries of the government
of New Brunswick’.</p>

<p>Uncertainty as to what was or was not British territory
affected among other matters the administration of justice.
It was from this point of view that Dorchester
mainly regarded it when he wrote in reply to Grenville,
‘the attainment of a free course of justice throughout
every part of His Majesty’s possessions in the way least
likely to give umbrage to the United States appears to
me very desirable’. He returned the draft of the Bill
with the blank filled in with a precise description of the
dividing line within what was beyond dispute Canadian
territory, and with the addition of some general words
including in the Canadas all lands to the southward
‘now subject to or possessed by His Majesty’, but he
reported at the same time that the Chief Justice was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
satisfied that the terms used would answer the purpose.
Eventually the Government left out the whole clause,
omitting also all reference to another difficult point
which had been raised and which had affected the administration
of justice in connexion with the fisheries in the
Gulf of St. Lawrence, viz., the boundary line between
Lower Canada and New Brunswick. Parliamentary
debate on a very awkward question was thus avoided,
and the Act contained no provision which could give
offence to the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">How the
boundaries
were
defined.</div>

<p>But it was absolutely necessary to draw some dividing
line, and to give some description of the boundaries,
however vague. Accordingly the following very cautious
course was taken. A ‘description of the intended boundary
between the provinces of Upper Canada and Lower
Canada’, being Lord Dorchester’s clause with the omission
of the general words referred to above, was printed as
a Parliamentary Paper,<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> while the Bill was before the
House; and this line of division was embodied in an
Order in Council issued on the following 24th of August,
with the addition of the words ‘including all territory
to the Westward and Southward of the said line, to the
utmost extent of the country commonly known as Canada’.
The line of division was set out again in the new commission
to Lord Dorchester, which was issued on the
12th of September, 1791, the two provinces of Upper
and Lower Canada being specified as comprehending
all such territories to the Westward and Eastward of
the line respectively ‘as were part of our said province
of Quebec’.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Administration
of Justice
hardly
mentioned
in
the Act,</div>

<p>On the important subject of administration of justice
the Act was almost silent. One section only had reference
to it, constituting the governor or lieutenant-governor
and Executive Council in either province a court of appeal
in civil matters, as had been the case in the undivided <span class="sidenote">Nor did it contain any definition of the respective powers of the two Chambers.</span>
province. Nor was any attempt made to define the
powers of the Legislative Council and Assembly in relation
to each other; but, in sending out the Act, Dundas,
who had succeeded Grenville, reminded Dorchester of ‘the
disputes and disagreements which have at times taken
place between the Councils and Assemblies of the different
colonies respecting the right claimed by the latter that
all Bills whatsoever for granting money should originate
with them’, and he laid down in general terms that the
principle, ‘as far as it relates to any question of imposing
burthens upon the subject, is so consistent with the spirit
of our constitution that it ought not to be resisted’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Contents
of the
Act.</div>

<p>Out of the fifty sections which composed the Act, no
less than thirty-two related to the constitution and
legislative powers of the Councils and Assemblies in the
two provinces. In Upper Canada the Legislative Council
was to consist of not less than seven members, and the
Assembly of not less than sixteen. In Lower Canada
the minimum fixed for the Council was fifteen, and for
the Assembly fifty. The electoral qualification was, in
the country districts, ownership of real property to the
net annual value of forty shillings, and in the towns of
£5, or in the alternative in the latter case a rental qualification
of £10 per annum.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Provision
for Protestant
clergy.</div>

<p>Of the remaining sections eight related to the endowment
and maintenance of Protestant clergy and to providing
parsonages and rectories for the Church of England.
The wording of these sections, and the system of clergy
reserves which they introduced, proved a fruitful source
of controversy in after years. The Act continued the
existing system by which Roman Catholics paid their
dues to the Roman Catholic Church, while the tithes
on lands held by Protestants were applied to the support<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
of a Protestant clergy. It then went on, in accordance
with the terms of the Royal Message to the House of
Commons, to provide that there should be a permanent
appropriation of Crown lands for the maintenance and
support of a Protestant clergy, bearing a due proportion
to the amount of Crown lands which had already been
granted for other purposes, and that all future grants
of Crown land should be accompanied by an appropriation,
for the same object of maintaining a Protestant
clergy, of land equal in value to one-seventh of the amount
which was granted for other purposes. The intention
was that the establishment and endowment of Protestant
clergy should proceed <i>pari passu</i> with the alienation of
lands for settlement, so that each township or parish
in either province should have its Protestant minister.
So far the general term Protestant was used, but provisions
followed authorizing the erection and endowment of parsonages
or rectories in every parish or township ‘according
to the Establishment of the Church of England’,
the incumbents to be ministers of the Church of England,
and to be subject to the ecclesiastical authority of the
Church of England bishop. It was also enacted that,
while these provisions relating to religion and to Crown
lands might be varied by Acts of the provincial legislatures,
before any such Acts received the Royal Assent, they
were to be laid before the Imperial Parliament, and,
if either House presented an Address to the King praying
that His assent should be withheld, such assent could
not be given. The Act, though obscurely worded, in
effect established and endowed the Church of England
in both provinces alike, while confirming the rights which
had already been conceded to the Roman Catholic Church.
The provision made for the Church of England was, at
any rate on paper, very ample, inasmuch as, while Crown
lands were being assigned for its maintenance, the liability
of Protestant land-owners to pay tithes was not abolished.
Dundas, however, in his dispatch which enclosed copies
of the Act, intimated to the governor that it was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
desired permanently to continue the burden of the tithe,
if the land-owners would in lieu subscribe to a fund for
clearing the reserve lands and building the parsonage
houses. Fox attacked these sections in the Act, and he
also criticized a suggestion which Pitt made that a
Church of England bishop might be given a seat in the
Legislative Council.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The first
Church of

North
America.</div>

<p>It may be noted that the Act specifically mentioned
the Bishop of Nova Scotia as the spiritual authority
for the time being over such ministers of the Church of
England as might be appointed to the two Canadas.
The Bishopric of Nova Scotia dated from 1787, and was
the first, and in 1791 the only, Church of England bishopric
in British North America, the Bishop—Bishop Inglis,
having been a Loyalist clergyman in the city of New York.
In 1793 a separate Bishop of Quebec was appointed, and
in 1799 the Secretary of State authorized the building
of a metropolitan church at Quebec, which was completed
for consecration in 1804, and at the centenary of which
in 1904 the Archbishop of Canterbury was present.
There were indications at this time that the Protestants
in Canada, most of whom were not members of the Church
of England, might be inclined to unite within it, and it
was hoped that the building and endowment of a metropolitan
church might tend to such union and to placing
the Church of England in the position of the Established
Church of Canada.</p>

<p>The provisions in the Act which related to religion
were followed by three very important sections dealing
with land tenure. The main grievance of the settlers <span class="sidenote">Provisions relating to land tenure, and to taxation by the Imperial Parliament.</span>
in Upper Canada was met by providing that land grants
should there be made on the English system of free and
common soccage. The same system was made optional
in Lower Canada at the will of the grantee, but in that
province the seigniors were not finally abolished until
the year 1854. In 1778 an Act of Parliament had been
passed<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a>—too late in the day—which abolished the tea<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
duty in the North American colonies, and laid down
that no duty should in future be imposed by the British
Parliament on any colony in North America or the West
Indies for revenue purposes, but only for the regulation
of commerce, and on the understanding that the net
produce of such duties should be at the disposal of the
colonial legislatures. Similar provisions were inserted
in the Canada Act of 1791, and, in introducing the Bill,
Pitt explained that, ‘in order to prevent any such dispute
as had been the cause of separating the thirteen states
from the mother country, it was provided that the
British Parliament should impose no taxes but such as
were necessary for the regulation of trade and commerce;
and, to guard against the abuse of this power, such taxes
were to be levied and to be disposed by the Legislature
of each division.’</p>

<p>Thus Canada was endowed with representative institutions,
and entered on the second stage in its history as
a British possession. It was divided into an English
province and a French province, in order as far as possible
to prevent friction between two races not yet accustomed
to each other. For the English province English land
tenure was made the law of the land, in the French
province it was only made optional. Taxation of members
of one religion for the upkeep of another found no place
in the Act, nor did taxation of a colony by the mother
country for the purposes of Imperial revenue. The
popular representatives were in the main given control of
the moneys raised from taxes: and no doubt was left as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
to who had the keeping of the people’s purse.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> On the
other hand the Executive power was left with the Crown,
and the waste lands provided possibilities of a revenue
by which the government might be supported apart from
the taxes, and by which an Established Church might be
maintained apart from the tithes. The Imperial Parliament
too retained the power of regulating commerce,
while making no money out of the colony by any commercial
regulations. It was in short a prudent and tolerant
half-way Act, wise and practical in view of the times and
the local conditions, and it was evidence that England
and Englishmen had learnt good and not evil from the
War of American Independence. A study of Canadian
history, with special reference to the Quebec Act of 1774
and the Canada Act of 1791, and the results which flowed
from them, leads to the conclusion that in either case
the British Government of the day tried most honestly
and most anxiously to deal with a very complicated
problem on its merits; that every effort was made by
the ministers of the Crown to mete out fair and considerate
treatment to the majority of the resident population in
Canada; and that those who framed and carried the
laws guided themselves by living facts rather than by
<i>a priori</i> reasoning. But it is also impossible to resist
the conclusion that at almost any time from 1783 onwards,
until the Canadian Dominion came into being, there was
little to choose between the arguments for retaining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
a single province, and those for constituting two provinces.
In any case it was inevitable that the provisions of the
Act of 1791 should give rise to new complications of
various kinds; and apart from specific questions, constitutional
and otherwise, there were two very practical
difficulties which necessarily arose from the division of the
province of Quebec. The first was an Executive difficulty,
of which more will be said presently. From the date
of the Act there was increasingly divided authority in
the Canadas. The second was a financial difficulty arising
from geographical conditions. One of the two provinces
had the keeping of the other, so far as regarded access
from and to the sea.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Financial
difficulties
between
the two
provinces.</div>

<p>As the line of division was drawn, Upper Canada,
like the Transvaal at the present day, was compelled
to import all sea-borne articles through territory under
the administration of another government, either through
Lower Canada or through the United States. The
St. Lawrence being the high road of import and export,
Lower Canada commanded the trade of Upper Canada.
Therefore, in order to collect a customs revenue, it was
necessary for the Upper Province either to establish
customs houses on the frontier of Lower Canada—a
measure which would probably have been ineffective
and would certainly have involved much inconvenience
and expense, or to come to some arrangement whereby
a certain proportion of the duties levied at Quebec,
which was the port of entry of Lower Canada, would
be handed over to the administration of the Upper
Province. The latter course was taken, and in 1795,
a provisional arrangement was made, by which the
proportion was fixed for the time being at one-eighth.
The record of what followed is a record of perpetual
friction, of commissions and temporary arrangements
confirmed by provincial Acts. It was suggested that the
boundaries of the provinces should be altered, and that
Montreal should be included in and be made the port of
entry of Upper Canada, but the suggestion was never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
carried into effect. As the population of Upper Canada
grew, the discontent increased. In 1818 one-fifth of
the duties was temporarily assigned to Upper Canada.
Then a complete deadlock ensued, which ended with the
Imperial Canada Trade Act of 1822. By arbitration
under the terms of that Act the proportion which Upper
Canada was to receive was in 1824 raised to one-fourth;
and when Lord Durham reported, it was about two-fifths.
In his report Lord Durham referred to the matter as ‘a
source of great and increasing disputes’, which only
came to an end when the two provinces were once more
united under the Imperial Act of 1840.</p>

<p>The Canada Act took effect on the 26th of December,
1791. Dorchester was then in England, and Sir Alured
Clarke, Lieutenant-Governor of the province of Quebec
under the old system and Commander of the Forces in
British North America, was acting for him. Under the <span class="sidenote">The position in Canada when the new Act came into force.</span>
new Act Clarke was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of
Lower Canada, while the Lieutenant-Governorship of
Upper Canada was conferred upon Colonel Simcoe, both
officers being subordinate to Dorchester as Governor-in-Chief.
Dorchester had left Canada on the 18th of August,
1791, and did not return till the 24th of September,
1793. His prolonged absence was unfortunate in more
ways than one. Technical difficulties arose owing to
the absence of the Governor-in-Chief, for, as soon as the
new Act came into force, Clarke’s authority was confined
by his commission to Lower Canada. The practical
effect too was that Simcoe started on his new charge
with a free hand and found it irksome, when Dorchester
returned, to take a second place. Added to this were
the complications caused by the French declaration
of war against Great Britain in February, 1793, the
hostilities between the United States and the Indian
tribes on the border land of Canada, and the persistent
and increasing bitterness in the United States against
Great Britain, caused partly by sympathy with the French
Revolution and the intrigues of French agents, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
partly by the British retention of the frontier forts and
supposed British sympathy with the Indians.</p>

<p>However, the political arrangements in Canada were
carried into effect without any appreciable friction.
Clarke, a man of judgement and discretion, did not hurry
matters in Lower Canada. He divided the province
into electoral districts, and summoned the Legislature
for its first session at Quebec on the 17th of December,
1792, when the Act had been in force for nearly a year.
The session then lasted into May. Simcoe arrived at
Quebec on the 11th of November, 1791; but, as no
Executive Council had yet been constituted for Upper
Canada, he could not be sworn in as Lieutenant-Governor
and take up his duties until the following midsummer,
Upper Canada being in the meantime left without any
governor or lieutenant-governor. In July, 1792, he issued
a proclamation at Kingston, dividing Upper Canada into
districts, and on the 17th of September the new Legislature
met for the first time at Newark, on the Canadian side
of the Niagara river, near where that river flows into
Lake Ontario. The Lieutenant-Governor fixed his head
quarters at ‘Navy Hall’, a building constructed in the
late war for the use of the officers of the naval department
on Lake Ontario. It stood by the water’s edge, nearly
a mile higher up the river than Newark; and on the
bank above, in the war of 1812, covering the buildings
below, stood the historic Fort George. The session was
a short one, closing on the 15th of October, but important
work was done. English law and procedure, and trial
by jury, were established, while proposals for taxation
and the state of the marriage law gave a field for difference
of opinion and debate. When the session was over,
Simcoe reported that he found the members of the
Assembly ‘active and zealous for particular measures,
which were soon shown to be improper or futile’, and
the Council ‘cautious and moderate, a valuable check
upon precipitate measures’.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span><a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Simcoe.</div>

<p>John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant-Governor
of Upper Canada, was the son of a naval officer who died
when serving under Admiral Saunders in the fleet which
helped to take Quebec. The son, who derived his second
name from another sailor, his godfather Admiral Graves,
was born in 1752. He was born in Northumberland,
but after his father’s death, his mother made her home
in Devonshire. He was educated at Exeter Grammar
School, at Eton, and at Merton College, Oxford, and he
joined the army in 1771, when he was nineteen years
old. He served with much distinction in the War of
Independence, in which he commanded a Loyalist Corps,
known as the Queen’s Rangers. When the war ended,
he held the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After his return
to England in bad health he spent some years at his
family home in Devonshire, he married, and in 1790
became a member of Parliament, sitting for the borough
of St. Mawes in Cornwall. His Parliamentary career was
very short, for in 1791, before he was yet forty years of
age, Pitt appointed him to be Lieutenant-Governor of
Upper Canada. He left Canada in 1796, and soon after
he reached England he was sent out as Governor to St.
Domingo. After a few months in the island, the state
of his health compelled him to come home. He became
a lieutenant-general, and was appointed to be Commander-in-Chief
in India in succession to Lord Lake, but he never
took up the appointment. Prior to going out he was
sent to Lisbon in 1806 on a special mission, was taken
ill, and brought home to die. He died at Exeter in October,
1806. There is a monument to him by Flaxman in Exeter
Cathedral<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>, and in Canada his name is borne by Lake
Simcoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>He was not only a good soldier, but a capable, vigorous,
public-spirited man, well suited in many ways to be
the pioneer governor of a new province. He was strong
on questions of military defence and a great road maker.
He made Yonge Street, the road from Toronto north
to Lake Simcoe, called after Sir George Yonge then
Secretary of State for War and afterwards for a short
time Governor of the Cape; and he made Dundas Street,
christened after the Secretary of State for the Colonies,
which then started from the point on Lake Ontario where
the city of Hamilton now stands and, running west,
connected with the river Thames.</p>

<div class="sidenote">York or
Toronto.</div>

<p>Toronto owed much to him, but not under its present
name. The name Toronto had been borne in old times
by Lake Simcoe, and on the site of the present city of
Toronto the French had in 1749<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> built a fort, named
Fort Rouillé. The place had come to be known as
Toronto, but in 1792<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> the new name of York came into
vogue, and in the autumn of the following year, 1793,
Simcoe reported that that name had been officially
adopted ‘with due celebrity’, in honour of the successful
storming of the French camp at Famars near Valenciennes
by the force under the command of the Duke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
of York on the 23rd of May, 1793. It was not until
1834, when the city was incorporated, that the old name
of Toronto was restored. Simcoe wrote of Toronto <span class="sidenote">Simcoe’s views as to the seat of government for Upper Canada.</span>
Harbour as ‘the proper naval arsenal of Lake Ontario’;
but it was not here that he would have placed the seat
of government. Strongly convinced of the necessity of
opening communication between Lake Ontario and the
upper lakes, without making the long round by the
waters of Lake Erie and the Straits of Detroit, in 1793
he explored the peninsula between the three lakes of
Ontario, Erie and Huron; and on a river, running
westward into Lake St. Clair, known at that date as the
La Tranche river and afterwards as the Thames<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>, a place
which was christened London and where there is now
a city with 40,000 inhabitants, seemed to him to be the
most suitable site for the political centre of Upper Canada.
His view was that the seat of government should be
inland, presumably because it would be more central in
respect to the three lakes, and also because it would be
further removed from the danger of raids from the neighbouring
territory of the then unfriendly republic. It is
interesting to note that, in a dispatch expressing an opinion
to the above effect, Simcoe added that sooner or later
the Canadas might be divided into three instead of two
provinces and Montreal be made the centre of an intermediate
government. Dorchester held, as against Simcoe,
that Toronto should be the seat of government, and his
view prevailed. The Legislature of Upper Canada met
at Newark for the last time in May, 1796, shortly before
the fort of Niagara on the opposite side of the river was
handed over to the Americans,<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> and from 1797 onwards,
Simcoe having left in the meanwhile, it met at Toronto.</p>

<p>Before Dorchester returned to take up again the duties<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
of Governor-in-Chief, Simcoe had formed definite views <span class="sidenote">Friction between Dorchester and Simcoe.</span>
as to the civil administration and the military defence
of Upper Canada; and it is not surprising that the keen,
active-minded soldier and administrator, who was little
more than forty years of age, did not on all points see
eye to eye with the veteran governor now verging on
seventy; or that, when he differed, he was not inclined
to subordinate his opinions to those of Dorchester. Thus
we find Dorchester sending home correspondence with
Simcoe with the blunt remark that the enclosures turned
on the question whether he was to receive orders from
Simcoe or Simcoe from him. In his long official career
Dorchester had been much tried. At the time of the
War of Independence, he had been badly treated by his
employers in England and had felt to the full the mischief
and inconvenience caused when those employers divided
their confidence and communicated with one subordinate
officer and another, thereby encouraging disloyalty and
intrigue. The correspondence of these later years points
to the conclusion that the iron had entered into his soul
and that, with the weariness of age growing upon him,
he had become somewhat querulous, unduly apprehensive
of loss of authority, and over-sensitive to difference of
opinion. There seems to have been no love lost between
him and Dundas, while the latter was Secretary of State,
but all through the last stage of his career the key-note
was dread of divided authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dorchester’s
views in
favour of
a Central
Legislature
and
a strong
Executive.</div>

<p>We have seen that he had not favoured the policy of
dividing the province of Quebec into two provinces, and
that he had shown sympathy with Chief Justice Smith’s
proposals for establishing a general government for
British North America. In the summer of 1793, after
the Canada Act had come into force but while he was
still in England on leave, he raised again this question
of a central government for all the King’s provinces
in British North America, receiving an answer from
Dundas to the effect that the measure would require
a new Act of Parliament and that in Dundas’ opinion it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
would not add to the real strength or happiness of the
different provinces. After his return to Canada Dorchester
took up his text again, laying stress on the necessity
of welding together the different provinces. In existing
conditions he saw a revival of the system which had
caused rebellion and the dismemberment of the Empire.
While the United States were pursuing a policy of consolidation,
the aim of the King’s Government seemed to
be to divide and sub-divide and form independent governments.
All power, he continued, was withdrawn from
the Governor-General, and instructions were sent directly
from home to inferior officers, so that the intermediate
authority was virtually superseded. Everything was
favourable to insubordination, and the fruits of it might
be expected at an early season. This was in February
1795, when the governor was smarting under what he
considered to be unjust censure by the Home Government;
and, though he remained in Canada for some
time longer, he continued to show, by the tone of his
dispatches, that he entirely disapproved of the existing
régime. In November, 1795, he wrote of ‘all command,
civil and military, being disorganized and without remedy’;
in the following May he wrote that ‘this unnatural
disorder in our political constitution, which alienates
every servant of the Crown from whoever administers the
King’s Government, leaving only an alternative still
more dangerous, that of offending the mass of the
people, cannot fail to enervate all the powers of the British
Empire on this Continent’; and in June he wrote, that
the old colonial system was being strengthened with
ruinous consequences.</p>

<p>It is not easy to decide how much ground there was
for his complaints. If the situation was difficult, the
difficulty had partly arisen from the bad custom, of
which he had availed himself, of allowing governors and
other holders of posts in the colonies to remain for an
inordinate time at home while still retaining office and
receiving the pay attaching to it. At the very time when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
he was most wanted in Canada to carry out the division
of the two provinces, and to make the central authority of
the Governor-in-Chief strongly felt from the first, he had
remained away for fully two years, thereby allowing the
new system to come into being and to make some progress
before there was any Governor-in-Chief on the spot.
Coming out to Canada he found the Lieutenant-Governors
corresponding direct with the Home Government, and
it was hardly reasonable to insist that they should be
debarred from doing so, provided that, as the Duke of
Portland, who succeeded Dundas, pointed out, the
Governor-in-Chief was supplied with copies of the correspondence.
An analogous case is that of Australia at
the present day. The governors of the separate states
correspond directly with the Colonial Office, sending
copies of important dispatches to the Governor-General
of the Commonwealth. Had Dorchester not been absent, <span class="sidenote">Relations of the Governor-in-Chief and Lieutenant-Governors.</span>
when Simcoe took up his appointment in Upper Canada,
and had his mind not been prejudiced by bitter memories
of the days of Germain, it is possible that friction might
not have arisen. On the other hand the limits of the
authority of the Governor-in-Chief and of the Lieutenant-Governors
in the British North American provinces seem
not to have been clearly defined, with the result that,
as years went on, the Governor-in-Chief gradually became
little more than Governor of Lower Canada, and the
Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada became, in civil
matters, governor of that province in all but the name.
When Lord Dalhousie was appointed Governor-in-Chief,
Sir Peregrine Maitland, then Lieutenant-Governor of
Upper Canada, asked the Secretary of State for a ruling
on the subject; and Lord Bathurst’s answer, dated the
9th of February, 1821, was that ‘So long as the Governor-in-Chief
is not resident within the province of Upper
Canada, and does not take the oaths of office in Upper
Canada, he has no control whatever over any part of the
civil administration, nor are you bound to comply with
his directions or to communicate with him on any act<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
of your civil government. To His Majesty you are alone
responsible for the conduct of the civil administration’.
If, on the other hand, the Governor-in-Chief were to take
up his residence in Upper Canada and be sworn into
office, the Secretary of State laid down that the functions
of the Lieutenant-Governor would be entirely suspended.
By this date, therefore, the two appointments had become
exclusive of each other. At a later date, when Lord
Durham was going out to Canada, Lord Glenelg, then
Secretary of State, emphasized still more strongly the independence
of the Lieutenant-Governors. When sending
Lord Durham his commission, he wrote on the 3rd of
April, 1838, of the position which the Governor-General
or Governor-in-Chief had up to that date held in regard
to the other provinces. ‘With the title of Governor-General,
he has, in fact, been Governor of the province of
Lower Canada only, and has been prohibited from resorting
to any of the other provinces, lest his presence should
supersede the authority of the respective Lieutenant-Governors,
to whose administration they have been
confided.... Hitherto it has not been the practice
to carry on official correspondence between the Governor-General
and any of the Lieutenant-Governors. The Governor-General
and the Lieutenant-Governors have severally
conducted their separate administrations as separate and
independent authorities, addressing all their communications
on public affairs to the head of this department, and
receiving from the Secretary of State alone instructions for
their guidance.’ The result of dividing Canada into two
provinces was necessarily to create two governors. One
was intended to be subordinate to the other, but the
subordination gradually became nominal only. The
political problems of Lower Canada were so difficult and
so important as to absorb the full time and attention of
the Governor-in-Chief; no railways or telegraphs facilitated
communication; and the British North American
provinces, instead of being controlled by a central executive
authority, for good or evil went their own way.</p>

<p>It has been seen that during Dorchester’s first government,
he had experienced no little difficulty in dealing
with Livius, the contumacious Chief Justice of Quebec.
In the earlier period of his second government, he had,
on the contrary, a wise and loyal fellow worker in Chief
Justice Smith. Soon after the governor returned to
Canada for the last time, towards the end of 1793, Smith
died and his place was taken by Osgoode, the Chief
Justice of Upper Canada, who did not enjoy Dorchester’s
confidence to the same extent as his predecessor. But
Osgoode’s appointment was made the occasion for putting
into practice a reform which Dorchester, to his lasting <span class="sidenote">Dorchester’s opposition to fees and perquisites.</span>
honour, had urgently pressed upon the notice of the
Imperial Government, the abolition of fees and perquisites,
and the payment of judges and other public
officers by adequate salaries alone. Dorchester himself,
when he first took up the government of Canada in 1766,
had refused to take the fees to which he was legally
entitled; and in the last years of his Canadian service
he wrote on this subject in no measured terms. In a
dispatch dated the last day of December, 1793, and
written in connexion with the vacant chief justiceship,
he referred to the system of fees and perquisites as one
which ‘alienates every servant of the Crown from whoever
administers the King’s Government. This policy I consider
as coeval with His Majesty’s Governments in North
America, and the cause of their destruction. As its
object was not public but private advantage, so this
principle has been pursued with diligence, extending
itself unnoticed, till all authority and influence of government
on this continent was overcome, and the governors
reduced almost to mere corresponding agents, unable to
resist the pecuniary speculations of gentlemen in office,
their connexions and associates’. He added that whatever
tended to enfeeble the Executive power in British
North America tended to sever it for ever from the
Crown of Great Britain. Subsequent dispatches were
to the same effect. In June, 1795, he reported having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
disallowed certain small claims by subordinate officers,
expressed regret that gentlemen in Britain should look
to America for a reward for their services, and laid down
that officers should be paid sufficient salaries to place
them above pecuniary speculations in the colonies. The
next month he wrote in the same strain with reference
to the Customs officials and the collection of revenue:
and a year later he again insisted that such officers
should not receive indirect emoluments, that the local
administration should not be warped and made subservient
to fees, profits, perquisites ‘and all their dirty
train’, and that the national interests should not be
sacrificed to gentlemen who possessed or were looking
out for good places for themselves and their connexions.
Running through the dispatches is insistence on the
principle that the Executive must be strong, that it
can be strong only if the officers are duly subordinate to
the representative of the Crown, that loyal subordination
can only be produced by paying proper salaries
and abolishing perquisites, and that the loss of the old
North American colonies had been largely due to abuses
which had lowered the dignity and the authority of
the Crown, alienating from it the confidence and the
affections of the people.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Dorchester

for plain
speaking
as to the
Americans.</div>

<p>The censure, if censure it can be called, which Dundas
had passed on Dorchester, and which caused the latter
to tender his resignation, was connected with the attitude
which Dorchester felt it necessary to take up towards
the United States after his return to Canada in the
autumn of 1793. The Treaty of 1783 had settled, or purported
to settle, the boundaries of Canada as against
the United States, but it had not settled the boundaries
of the United States as against the Indians, and the
Indians manfully maintained their right to the territory <span class="sidenote">War between the Americans and the Indians.</span>
north of the Ohio river. In November, 1791, an American
force under General St. Clair, who had commanded at
Ticonderoga at the time of Burgoyne’s advance, was
badly defeated in the Miami country to the south-west<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
of Lake Erie. The British Government and the Canadian
authorities made various efforts to mediate between
the contending parties, but the government of the United
States was not disposed to accept such mediation, though
British officers were asked to be present at conferences
which were held in the summer of 1793 between representatives
of the various Indian tribes and commissioners
of the United States. No result came from these negotiations,
the Indians demanding that the Ohio should be
the boundary, the Americans definitely refusing to
comply with the demand, and in the following year
fighting began again.</p>

<p>The French Revolution had for some years been gathering
strength. In the autumn of 1792 France had been
declared a Republic; and the execution of the King <span class="sidenote">American sympathy with France.</span>
on the 21st of January, 1793, was followed on the 1st of
February by a declaration of war against Great Britain.
The French also declared war against Spain, the power
which now held New Orleans and Louisiana west of the
Mississippi. The position in North America became at
once very critical and very dangerous. Popular feeling
in the United States ran strongly in favour of France.
The Republicans of the New World were enthusiastic
for the people who had enabled them to gain their independence
and who, having put an end to monarchy in
France, were preparing to insist upon the adoption of a
Republican system elsewhere in Europe. Sympathy with
France in the United States implied enmity to England,
and Thomas Jefferson, Washington’s Secretary of State,
was pronounced on the side of the French alliance, representing
the views of the Republican party as opposed
to the Federalists, the latter being headed by Alexander
Hamilton and Jay and supported by the unrivalled
influence of Washington himself. On the 22nd of April,
1793, Washington—with popular feeling strongly against
him in the matter—issued a declaration of neutrality.
At the same time, Genet, sent from France as representative <span class="sidenote">Genet, French minister to the United States.</span>
of the new Republic, reached Charleston. With<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
complete disregard of international law, which, when the
French Revolution was at its height, had largely lost
its meaning, Genet proceeded to make the United States
a base for war against Great Britain and Spain, fitting
out privateers, sending agents to Canada, planning a
campaign against Louisiana. For some months the
popularity of his country and his cause, the unpopularity
of Great Britain, and the sympathy which Jefferson
the Secretary of State had with his views, enabled him,
in Washington’s words, to set the acts of the American
Government at defiance with impunity and to threaten
the Executive with an appeal to the people; but gradually
Washington’s firmness and the Frenchman’s own outrageous
pretensions had due effect; and, before a year
had passed, Genet was, early in 1794, on the demand of
the American Government, replaced by another minister.</p>

<p>It was while the bitterness of feeling against England
in the United States was most intense that Dorchester <span class="sidenote">Danger of war between Great Britain and the United States.</span>
returned to Canada. St. Clair had been replaced in
command on the Ohio frontier by General Anthony
Wayne, a soldier who had proved his worth in the War
of Independence, a man of strong words and actions,
and war seemed to be imminent. ‘Soon after my return to
America,’ Dorchester wrote in the following year, ‘I perceived <span class="sidenote">Dorchester’s views.</span>
a very different spirit’ (from that of the British
Government) ‘animate the United States, much heat
and enmity, extraordinary exertions, some open some
covert, to inflame the passions of the people, all things
moving as by French impulse rapidly towards hostilities,
and the King’s Government of Lower Canada in danger
of being overwhelmed, so that I considered a rupture as
inevitable.’ Yet, as he said, he knew well that the
British Government were anxious to maintain friendship
and peace with the United States; there was no
private inclination of his own to the contrary; nor, if
there was, had he any force in Canada to back his views.
In a previous dispatch, which was dated the 25th of
October, 1793, almost immediately after his return,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
after having pointed out the likelihood of war and the
necessity for reinforcements, he had written, ‘The interests
of the King’s American dominions require peace, and
I think the interests of the States require it still more,
though their conduct both to us and the Indians has
created many difficulties.’ He looked, he added, to
a great future for the States and for the white race
generally in North America, but not through war. ‘Not
war, but a pure and impartial administration of justice
under a mild, firm and wise government will establish
the most powerful and wealthy people.’</p>

<p>Dorchester then was wholly averse to war; but being
on the spot he saw more clearly than ministers in England
that, the people of the United States being minded for
war, want of preparation and appearance of timidity
on the British side were likely to bring it on, that
plain speaking and firm action might have a good effect. <span class="sidenote">His firm attitude towards the United States.</span>
Simcoe, who was responsible under him for the frontier of
Upper Canada, seems to have been of the same mind.
Accordingly, in replying to two Indian deputations, one
in the autumn of 1793, the other on the 10th of February,
1794, Dorchester took occasion to speak out, condemning
the aggression of the United States which, he said, had
nearly exhausted the patience of Great Britain, and
referring to war between the two nations as imminent.
At the same time, as a counterblast to Wayne’s advance
in the Ohio territories, and as an outpost in the case of
a movement against Detroit, he ordered a fort to be
constructed and garrisoned on what were called the
Miami rapids on the Maumee river, south-west of Lake
Erie, near the site where a fort had been constructed
and held during the War of Independence. Copies, or
what purported to be copies, of the governor’s speeches, <span class="sidenote">Protest of the American Government against Dorchester.</span>
and reports of his action, reached the American Government
in due course, and Randolph, who had succeeded
Jefferson, protested, characterizing them as ‘hostility
itself’. In view of this protest Dundas, in July, 1794,
by which time Jay, Washington’s emissary of peace,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
had arrived in England, addressed a mild remonstrance to
Dorchester, expressing fear that what had been said and
done might rather provoke hostilities than prevent them;
and upon receipt of this dispatch in the following September
Dorchester tendered his resignation. The Duke of Portland,
who succeeded Dundas, was at pains to retain the old
governor’s services, but, though nearly two years intervened
before Dorchester actually left Canada, the correspondence <span class="sidenote">Dorchester’s resignation.</span>
which passed in the interval showed his
anxiety to be gone, now that the danger of war between
Great Britain and the United States had for the moment
passed away.</p>

<p>The most critical time was in the year 1794. In
America the forces which make for war were strongly
in evidence. On the other side of the Atlantic—to the
lasting credit of both the British and the American
Governments—representatives of the two countries were
working hard for peace. In the spring of 1794 Washington
nominated John Jay, Chief Justice of the United States,
to be a special envoy to Great Britain with a view to
settling, if possible, the outstanding points of dispute
between the two nations. The Senate confirmed the
nomination, and in June Jay reached England and entered
into negotiations with Lord Grenville. The result was
that on the 19th of November following Jay and Grenville <span class="sidenote">Jay’s treaty signed.</span>
signed the well-known treaty which is associated with
the American statesman’s name, and which provided
for an immediate or prospective settlement of many
if not of most of the questions at issue. The treaty
was bitterly attacked in the United States by the Republican
party and those who sympathized with France.
Jay, Hamilton, even Washington himself were denounced
and reviled; but the government had sufficient backing
in the country to procure the assent of the Senate to the
terms of the treaty, with the exception of one article,
in the session of 1795; Washington ratified it in August,
1795; and in the following year the measures for carrying <span class="sidenote">The border forts transferred to the United States in 1796.</span>
it into effect were voted by a small majority in the House<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
of Representatives. Under its provisions, in that same
year, 1796, the border forts were handed over to the
United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wayne
defeats
the
Indians.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the war between the Americans and Indians
ran the normal course of such wars. The white men
suffered some reverses; but, with a strong body of
regular troops supplemented by Kentucky militia, and
with the help of fortified posts constructed along the line
of advance, Wayne by August, 1794, had worn down the
Indians and menaced the British fort on the Maumee
river, to whose commandant, Major Campbell, he addressed
threatening letters. On either side, however, the orders
were to abstain from blows, while Jay and Grenville
were negotiating, and the conclusion of the treaty ensured
the abandonment by the British troops of this outpost
of Detroit as well as of Detroit itself. Next year, on
the 3rd of August, 1795, Wayne concluded the Treaty of
Greenville with the Western Indians. Under its terms the
Americans advanced their boundary beyond the Ohio,
but still left to the Indians on the south of Lake Erie
and in the peninsula of Michigan lands of which the
treaty definitely recognized them to be owners, and where
they were to dwell under the protection of the United
States.</p>

<p>In September, 1795, the Duke of Portland wrote to
Lord Dorchester telling him that General Prescott would <span class="sidenote">Dorchester and Simcoe leave Canada.</span>
be appointed Lieutenant-Governor of Lower Canada and
would leave for Canada in the spring, so that Dorchester
could suit his own convenience as to returning to England.
At the same time the Secretary of State repeated his
regret that Dorchester had determined to retire. Prescott
arrived on the 18th of June, 1796, and on the 9th of July
Dorchester embarked for England. His ship was wrecked
on the shore of Anticosti island, but he reached England in
safety in September, and died in a good old age in the
autumn of 1808. Simcoe, in the meantime, had, in
December, 1795, applied for leave of absence on account
of ill health, suggesting that Peter Russell, the senior<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
councillor, should in his absence administer the government
of Upper Canada, and tendering his resignation if
the leave could not be granted. His wish was complied
with, and, after being detained for some time at Quebec,
he came back with the returning ships of the autumn
convoy and was in London in 1796, two months after
Dorchester’s arrival. Canada saw him no more, and, as
has been told, he died at a comparatively early age,
outlived by the old Governor-in-Chief whose control had
fretted his impetuous spirit.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord
Dorchester’s
services
to Great
Britain
and
Canada.</div>

<p>In the colonial history of Great Britain Lord Dorchester’s
place is or ought to be second to none. Men should
be measured by the times in which they live, the lands
in which they serve, the conditions which they are called
upon to face. It did not fall to Carleton’s lot to be
borne on the flowing tide of British victories, to be a
leader in successful wars, to be remembered as one who
struck down England’s foes and added provinces to her
empire. Nor was it given to him to bear rule in times
of settled peace, when wisdom and statesmanship are
called on to gather in and store the harvest, to consolidate,
to develop, to reform, to enrich, to give security and
beneficent measures to trusting and expectant multitudes
of the human race. Providence set the span of his
active life while his country’s fortunes were running
out on the ebb-tide of adversity; his public services were
coincident with Great Britain’s depression; and the
part of the Empire in which he served was the scene of
her defeats. No men of good English type cheered and
supported him at home, the patriotism which inspired
his life was unknown alike to the ministers who preceded
William Pitt and to an Opposition which, as embodied
in Fox, lost all sense of proportion, and almost all sense
of duty, or principle. Yet he held Quebec and saved
Canada. Men turned to him to gather up the fragments
after the War of Independence; and he reconciled
French Canada to British rule and held the balance
even between conflicting races and creeds. Open warfare,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
political intrigue, in every form and from every
quarter, from without and from within, beset his path.
Those he served and those by whom he was served were
in turn disloyal to him. Colonial questions, such as in
times of profound peace and goodwill, and after generations
of experience, are yet almost insoluble, confronted him,
without precedent, without guidance, in their most uncompromising
form. He faced them, and through all the
mire and mud in which England and English civilians and
soldiers and sailors wallowed in these miserable years,
he carried one name at any rate which stood for dignity,
uprightness, and firm prescient statesmanship. It is not
to the credit of English memories or English perception
that his name has outside Canada passed into comparative
oblivion. If ever a man had temptation to despair of or
be untrue to his country, and if ever a man’s character
and work redeemed his country and his country’s cause in
unworthy times, that man was Carleton.</p>

<p>A great figure in the colonial history of Great Britain
as a whole, in the history of Canada he is very great
indeed. His character is poles apart from that of old
Count Frontenac, and yet he filled in some sort a similar
place. Both were soldier-governors; both came back
to rule a second time; in either case the individual
personality of a firm masterful man was the saving feature
of a time of life and death for the colony. Carleton
had none of Frontenac’s ruthlessness and arrogance, he
had not his French quick wit; but either man in his
turn, the one at the end of the seventeenth century,
the other towards the end of the eighteenth, was in the
fullest sense the saviour of Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">General
Prescott
succeeds
Dorchester.</div>

<p>Dorchester did not actually cease to be Governor-in-Chief
of Canada until the end of April, 1797, some months
after his return to England. He was then succeeded
in the office by Prescott, who in the meantime had been
Lieutenant-Governor of Lower Canada and Commander-in-Chief
of the British forces in North America, having
been sworn in at Quebec on the 12th of July, 1796.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
Robert Prescott, of Lancashire descent, was an old man
when he was sent to Canada. Born in 1725, he was
seventy-one years of age, only one year younger than
Dorchester. He was a Lieutenant-General in the army
and had seen much fighting, principally in North America
and the West Indies. He had served under Amherst
and Wolfe, at Louisbourg and Quebec. He had fought
in the War of American Independence and been present
at the battle of Brandywine. In 1794 he was in command
of the force which took Martinique from the French and,
as civil governor of the island, he earned the goodwill
of French and natives alike by his tact and humanity.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
Thus he had a good record when he was chosen to succeed
Lord Dorchester, and, though his rule in Canada was
short and stormy, when he left, there was abundant
evidence of his popularity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Intrigues
of the
French
minister
in the
United
States
against
Canada.</div>

<p>Before his arrival in 1796, and at the time, Adet the
French minister in the United States, was making mischief
like his predecessor Genet, intriguing against Washington’s
policy of strict neutrality as between France and Great
Britain, and almost openly inciting the French Canadians
to revolt. He over-reached himself, however, by supporting
Jefferson’s candidature for the Presidency of the
United States in succession to Washington, with the result
that he was recalled. Jefferson’s opponent, John
Adams, was elected President; and the feeling between
France and the United States became strained to the
verge of war between the two nations. The French
designs on Canada came to nothing. A man named
Maclane, said to have been of weak intellect, was executed
for high treason at Quebec, and a vessel was seized
containing arms, ostensibly for the state of Vermont,
but, as the evidence seemed to show, designed for use
in a raid from Vermont on Canada. There was no
actual danger, but there was anxiety and unrest. England
was at war with France; Lower Canada was the child of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
France; the United States contained a strong and
very bitter anti-English party; and the armed forces
in Canada were almost a negligible quantity. At this
same critical time Prescott became involved in a quarrel
with his Executive Council over the land question.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The land
question
in
Canada.
Prescott
quarrels
with his
Executive
Council.</div>

<p>A proclamation advertising Crown lands for settlement
in Canada, which was issued in 1792, had called forth
a large number of applications. Surveys had not kept
pace with the demand for allotments, and the result
had been that many applicants whose petitions had been
entertained had not actually taken up any land, while
others had settled and occupied land without having any
legal title. As is usual in such cases, land-jobbing was
prevalent; and Prescott, according to his own account,
was at pains at once to frustrate ‘great schemes for accumulating
land on principles of monopoly and speculation’,
and to raise the fund which the Imperial Government had
hoped to derive from this source for defraying in part
the cost of civil administration. Prescott’s view, it
would seem, was that those who had actually become
occupiers and begun the work of settlement, should be
confirmed in their lands in full; that, where applications
had been recorded but no work done, the allotments
should only be confirmed in part; that purchasers of
claims should be dealt with on their merits, and that,
the outstanding claims having been disposed of, the
lands, with the exception of reserves for the Crown and
the clergy, should be put up for sale at public auction.
His Council strongly opposed him, on the ground that
he was giving preference to those who had occupied land
without having been granted any legal title, and that
public sale would bring in a crowd of interlopers from
the United States who would take up the land to the
exclusion of Loyalists who had the first claim on the
British Government. Prescott formed the view, rightly
or wrongly, that various members of the Council were
concerned in land-jobbing, and he held that public
sale was the only real preventive of speculation. ‘Industrious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
farmers,’ he wrote, ‘who would wish to obtain
a grant for the purpose of actual settlement, but who
cannot spend their time in tedious solicitation, stand
little chance of obtaining it, compared with speculators
who can devote their time to the attainment of this object.
By disposing of the land at public sale, industrious
farmers would have an equal chance with any other
competitor.’</p>

<div class="sidenote">Benedict
Arnold’s
claims.</div>

<p>The case of Benedict Arnold, though it did not apparently
enter into the controversy, as he was in England
at the time, illustrates the extravagant claims which
were put forward to land grants in Canada. At the
beginning of 1797 he wrote to the Duke of Portland,
calling attention to the sacrifices which he had made for
the British Government, and asking for a reward in the
shape of a grant of lands in Canada. A year later he
defined his demand. He stated that the usual grant
was 5,000 acres to each field officer and 1,200 acres for
every member of his family; in his own case, therefore,
as his family consisted of a wife, six sons and a daughter,
the total would amount to 14,600 acres; but, as he had
raised and commanded what he called a legion of cavalry
and infantry, he considered that he himself was entitled
to 10,000 acres instead of 5,000, making up the total
to 19,600 acres. Even this amount he had amplified in a
previous petition to the King, and he wished to be
allowed to select the land where he pleased and not to
be compelled to reside upon it personally.</p>

<p>If Arnold’s claims were at all typical of others, it is
not to be wondered at that Prescott took a strong line
on the land question, with a view to putting a stop to
speculation. The controversy which arose between himself
and his Council was embittered by the course which
he adopted of making public their proceedings. Chief
Justice Osgoode and other members of the Council
ranged themselves in opposition to him; and the state
of feeling was well summed up in the words of a correspondent,
writing from Quebec in August, 1798, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
Council must either get a new governor or the governor
a new Council. The Duke of Portland, Secretary of State, <span class="sidenote">Prescott recalled.</span>
preferred the former alternative. On the 10th of April,
1799, he ordered Prescott home. Robert Shore Milnes
was sent out as Lieutenant-Governor of Lower Canada,
and General Hunter as Lieutenant-Governor of Upper
Canada. They reached Quebec on the 13th of June, and <span class="sidenote">Milnes and Hunter appointed Lieutenant-Governors of Lower and Upper Canada respectively.</span>
on the 29th of July Prescott sailed for England, having
received before he left addresses of confidence from all
classes, British and French residents combining to pay
honour to him, as a man, who, whatever his faults may
have been, had won the respect and esteem of the people.
By the evil custom of those days, though recalled from
Canada, he was allowed to retain for years in England
the office of Governor-General and to receive
the pay.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Close of
the eighteenth
century.</div>

<p>Thus the eighteenth century came to an end, that
memorable century, in all parts of the world fruitful
alike for good and for evil to the British Empire, but
nowhere so fruitful as in North America. It had seen
New France severed from its motherland. It had seen
the rival British colonies severed from Great Britain.
It had seen the beginnings of an English province in
Canada side by side with the French, and the grant of
the first instalment of political privileges to Canadians
of either race. The maritime provinces, when the
century closed, were four in number, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, which owed its separate existence to the
incoming of the Loyalists, Cape Breton, which was later
to be incorporated with Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward
Island. The North-West was beginning to be a factor
in Canadian history, and the exclusive power of the
Hudson’s Bay Company in these regions was challenged
by the formation of the North-West Company. Canada
was still the land of the St. Lawrence and the great lakes,
but light was breaking into the limitless area beyond,
and as men’s visions widened, there came more movement
and more unrest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span></p>

<p>We have no regular census of the two Canadas between
the year 1790, when there was an imperfect enumeration
of the inhabitants of the then undivided province, and
the years 1824-5; but in 1800 the Lieutenant-Governor
estimated the population of Lower Canada at 160,000,
while in 1806 an estimate of 250,000 is given from
another source, the population of Upper Canada in the
same year being estimated at 70,000. That at the end
of the century Lower Canada was politically and socially
in a state of transition is shown by an interesting dispatch
from Milnes written on the 1st of November, 1800,<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
in which, like his predecessors, he laid stress on the
necessity for taking steps to strengthen the Executive <span class="sidenote">Milnes’ views as to strengthening the Executive.</span>
Government. He pointed out causes which in his opinion
united ‘in daily lessening the power and influence of
the Aristocratical Body in Lower Canada’; and, curiously
enough, he considered the first and most important of
these to be the manner in which the province was originally <span class="sidenote">Independence of the Canadian habitants.</span>
settled, and the independent tenure by which the
cultivators or habitants held their lands. The feudal
system had been introduced with a view to keeping
the colonists in leading strings, and reproducing
in the New World a form of society based upon the
fundamental principle of a landed aristocracy. Yet
this English governor wrote of the habitants at the end
of the eighteenth century, that ‘there cannot be a more
independent race of people, nor do I believe there is in
any part of the world a country in which equality
of situation is so nearly established’. The land had
passed into the hands of the peasants from those of the
seigniors, who retained only the old-time privileges of a <span class="sidenote">Decay of the Canadian aristocracy.</span>
trifling rent, taking a fourteenth of the corn which the
habitants were still bound to grind at the seigniors’ mills,
and a twelfth of the purchase-money when lands were
transferred. The seigniors, the dispatch stated, showed no
disposition to enter into trade; their position had in many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
instances sunk below that of their vassals; and, taken as
a whole, the Canadian gentry had nearly become extinct.</p>

<p>The second cause to which Milnes attributed the
weakness of the government was ‘the prevalence of the
Roman Catholic religion and the independence of the <span class="sidenote">Independence of the Roman Catholic Church.</span>
priesthood’. The Royal Instructions were that no one
should be admitted to Holy Orders or have the Cure
of Souls without first obtaining a licence from the
governor; but the instructions had not been enforced,
and the whole patronage of the Roman Catholic Church
had passed into the hands of the bishops, with the
result that the power of the priests over the people was
entirely independent of the government. This evil Milnes
proposed to remedy by increasing the emoluments which
the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Canada
received from government funds, on condition that the
rule requiring the governor’s licences for the parish
priests was strictly observed in future.</p>

<p>The third cause which was mentioned as tending to
lessen the influence of the government, was the practical
disembodiment of the militia since Canada had passed <span class="sidenote">Disuse of the militia.</span>
under British rule. Under the old French dominion the
government had made itself felt in the various parishes
through the captains of militia and the parish priests,
and the captains of militia had been employed to issue
and enforce the public ordinances. They were, Milnes
wrote, chosen from among the most respectable of the
habitants; and though the militia had not been called
out for years past and he did not propose to call it out,
the captains of militia were still in existence and the
government availed itself of their honorary services on
public occasions. He suggested that they should be
given some salary or distinction so that they might
consider themselves to be ‘the immediate officers of the
Crown’; and thus he hoped to keep up the spirit of
loyalty among the Canadian people, which ‘for want of
an immediate class to whom they can look up, and from
their having no immediate connexion with the Executive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
power, is in danger of becoming extinct’.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> By attaching
to the government the parish priests and the captains of
militia, it might be possible to ensure a government
majority in the House of Assembly and to secure the
election of educated and businesslike representatives,
whereas the main body of the Canadian habitants were,
‘from their want of education and extreme simplicity,
liable to be misled by designing and artful men’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Crown
Lands.</div>

<p>These proposals the Lieutenant-Governor regarded as
temporary remedies. For the future, he looked to increasing
the influence of the Crown by means of the revenue
from waste lands, and the settlement of those lands by
‘a body of people of the Protestant religion that will
naturally feel themselves more immediately connected
with the English Government’. In the mind of Milnes,
as in that of Dorchester, there was a fixed conviction
that matters were tending to democracy, as democracy
had shown itself in the adjoining republic; that such
democracy meant disintegration; that the influence of
the Crown and of the Executive Government was declining
and would continue to decline, unless measures were
taken to counteract the evil. He held to the doctrine
that well-wishers of the government should think it matter
for congratulation that there was an annual deficit on
the budget of Lower Canada,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> which made the province
dependent upon the Imperial Government.</p>

<p>The records of the time show that in every respect
the close of the eighteenth and the beginning of the <span class="sidenote">The close of the eighteenth century was for Canada a time of transition and division.</span>
nineteenth century was for Canada a time of division
and a time of change, though not yet of dangerous bitterness.
There were two provinces instead of one. There
were two Lieutenant-Governors, independent of each
other, while the Governor-in-Chief, recalled to England,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
was still holding his post and drawing his pay. There
were elected Assemblies, to which the Executive was not
responsible, and the new century opened in Upper Canada
with a complaint that the Lieutenant-Governor had spent
money raised from the taxes without previously obtaining
a vote of the Legislature. There was a suggestion of
difficulties arising from the fact that military and civil
authority for the time was divided. An interesting
anonymous letter written from Quebec on the 28th of
July, 1806, and signed ‘Mercator’, called attention to
this point, alleging that, since Prescott’s recall in 1799,
Lower Canada had languished owing to the fact that
civil and military powers were not in the same hands.
The result, in the writer’s opinion, was jealousy between
the civil and military departments, weakening of the
energy of government and loss of dignity. ‘The Canadians’
he wrote, ‘a military people and always accustomed
to a military government, hold not in sufficient
estimation a person placed at the head of affairs who does
not at the same time command the troops.’<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<p>There was again undoubted division between the
Judicial and the Executive power. Chief Justice Osgoode
in Lower Canada was not at one with either Dorchester,
Prescott, or Milnes; while in Upper Canada, in the
years 1806-7, a judge of the name of Thorpe became
a member of the elected Assembly and was so outrageous
in his opposition to the government that he was by
Lord Castlereagh’s instructions suspended from his office.
The Church of England bishop found cause to deplore
the overshadowing pretensions of the Roman Catholic
Church. The Roman Catholic dignitaries, on the other
hand, asked for formal recognition of their position by
the civil government. There was a movement, strongly
advocated by the Church of England bishop, for more
and better education, both primary and secondary, so
that the French Canadian children might learn English,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
and the children of the upper classes might be educated
without being sent to Europe or to the United States.
The Secretary of State authorized free schools on the
express condition that English should be taught in them,
and directed that part of the Crown Lands revenues should
be set aside for the purpose. There was also a strong
feeling that the Jesuit estates, which long ago had been
granted by the King to Lord Amherst but had never
been handed over to him, should be applied to education.
But no general system of state education was established—probably
owing to Roman Catholic feeling; and,
as against the proposal to teach English to the coming
generation, there came into being in 1806 a French
Canadian newspaper, <i>Le Canadien</i>, with the motto, ‘Nos
institutions, notre langue et nos lois.’ Nothing in short
was settled in Canada. Once more it was to be shown
that pressure from without was necessary to produce
full co-operation within; and, badly equipped as the
two provinces were with means of defence, war was yet
to be to them a blessing in disguise, as bringing them a
step further on the path of national development.</p>

which the Order was based. The boundary line sketched out in the

America, has been found by experience to occasion great uneasiness

the charges of the Administration of Justice and support of the Civil
Government within the Province of Quebec in America.’ It was
contended that the effect of the Declaratory Act of 1778, together
with the Constitution Act of 1791, was to hand over the proceeds of
these taxes to be disposed of by the provincial legislatures. The
contention had no real basis, and the Law officers of the Crown reported
it to be unfounded, but eventually, by an Act of 1831 (1 and 2 Will. IV,
cap. 23), the legislatures of the two Canadas were empowered to appropriate
the revenues in question.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="fs80">SIR JAMES CRAIG</span></h2>


<p>As has been told in the last chapter, Milnes and Hunter,
Lieutenant-Governors of Lower and Upper Canada respectively,
took up their appointments in the summer of
1799 when the Governor-General Prescott was recalled <span class="sidenote">Changes in administration.</span>
to England. General Hunter was not only Lieutenant-Governor
of Upper Canada but also Commander of the
Forces in both provinces. These two men held their
appointments for six years, until August, 1805. On the
5th of that month Milnes, who was by this time a baronet,
Sir Robert Shore Milnes,<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> left for England on leave of
absence, and on the 21st of the month General Hunter
died at Quebec. For the time being, two civilians acted
as Lieutenant-Governors, Thomas Dunn, senior Executive
Councillor at Quebec, acting in Lower Canada, and
Alexander Grant acting in Upper Canada. Milnes
remained on leave of absence in England and drew his
salary for over three years. A new Lieutenant-Governor
of Lower Canada was then appointed, who in his turn
also remained in England for many years and received
pay in respect of an office the duties of which he did
not perform.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span><a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Evils of
absenteeism.</div>

<p>Thus it resulted that, at a very critical time, two
provinces of the British Empire, whose conditions were
specially critical, were left without a Governor-General,
without Lieutenant-Governors, and without a regular
Commander of the Forces, while two men, one holding
the office of Governor-General of the two Canadas and
the other holding the office of Lieutenant-Governor of
Lower Canada, were spending their time and drawing
their pay in England. We have learnt something in
the last hundred years, in regard to colonial administration,
and it is now difficult to appreciate a state of public
morality which showed so much indifference to the interests
of the colonies, so much acquiescence in sinecures,
and so much readiness on the part of capable and honourable
public officers to take pay without doing the work
to which the pay was nominally attached. But the
fact that such things took place, affords a very simple
explanation of the difficulties which had already arisen
and which subsequently arose in the history of European
colonization between a mother country and her colonies.
Men could put two and two together in those days as in
ours. If colonists saw the rulers of the ruling land
treating high offices in the colony as a matter of individual
profit and public indifference, they could only come to
the conclusion that they had better take care of themselves;
and if the answer came that governors and
lieutenant-governors were paid not by the colony but
by the mother country, then the colonists must needs
have concluded that they themselves would prefer to
find the money and to have the money’s worth. This
may well have been in the minds of the members of the
elected Assembly in Lower Canada when, at a little later
date, in 1810, they passed uninvited a resolution that the
province shall pay the cost of the civil government, a
resolution of which more was heard in the course of the
long constitutional struggle.</p>

<p>What made for keeping up the connexion with the
mother country was not so much what the mother country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
did for the colonies in peace, as the need which the
colonies had for the mother country in case of war.
An attempt has been made in the preceding chapters
of this book to show that good fortune has attended
Canada in her development into a nation. The conquest
by Great Britain tended to this end, so did the loss
by Great Britain of the provinces which now form the
United States. At the beginning of the nineteenth
century the cloud of war hung over Canada, but still
her good fortune did not desert her. There was perpetual <span class="sidenote">External dangers which threatened Canada at the beginning of the nineteenth century.</span>
danger from two quarters, from France and from the
United States. With France Canada, as being part of
the British Empire, was nominally at open war throughout
the closing years of the eighteenth and the early years
of the nineteenth century, except for the very short
interval which followed the conclusion of the Peace of
Amiens in 1802; but it is noteworthy how the political
complications inured to the preservation of Canada as <span class="sidenote">Hostility of France to Great Britain.</span>
a British possession. France and the United States had
strong bonds of sympathy. To French intervention the
United States largely owed their independence. Having
parted with their monarchy, the French were more
attractive than before to the citizens of the American
republic; and in the days of the American revolutionary
war Congress had pledged itself to defend for ever the
French possessions in America. The bulk of the Canadians,
French in race, tradition, language and religion, might
well be expected to be French in sympathies. How great
then might have seemed the probability that England
in war with France would lose Canada? It was no
wonder that such incidents as a visit of Jerome Bonaparte
to the United States caused uneasiness, or again that
a report was spread that Moreau, the French republican
general then living in exile in America, was likely to
lead an invasion of Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">French
Canadians
not
in sympathy
with the
French
Revolution.</div>

<p>But, as a matter of fact, neither were the Canadians
inclined to return to their French allegiance nor were
the people of the United States in the least likely to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
permit France to regain Canada. The Canadians had
known forty years of British rule, clean and just in comparison
with what had gone before, and the France
which would reclaim them was widely different from
the France to which they had once belonged. The
King was gone; religion was at a discount; Canadian
sympathies, at any rate in the earlier years of the revolutionary
wars, were rather with Royalist <i>emigrés</i> than with
the national armies who went on from victory to victory.
Above all antipathy to the United States, without whose
abetting or connivance, no French projects for regaining
Canada could have effect, tended to keep the
Canadians firm in their British allegiance. Thus the
news of the victory of Trafalgar was welcomed in
Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
United
States
not disposed
to
allow the
French to
regain
Canada.</div>

<p>Nor again were the Americans, however well disposed
to France, in any way or at any time minded to enable
her to regain her lost possessions in North America.
A Canadian who had left Canada for France when Canada
was annexed by Great Britain, wrote, before the conclusion
of the Peace of Amiens, expressing the hope
that Canada would be regained by France. He regarded
Canada, from the French point of view, ‘as a colony
essential to trade and as an outlet for merchandize and
men’; and he wrote that, if restored to France, it ‘would
constantly furnish the means of speculation which would
improve the future of the citizens whom war and revolution
have reduced to wretchedness’.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> The words read
as those of a man who had known and still sighed for
the days of the old French régime in Canada, when men
grew rich by illicit traffic; but, apart from the views
of individuals, there is no doubt that, as the eighteenth
century closed, France and the French people, after the
wars of the Revolution, with their power consolidated
at home, were in the stage of development favourable
to colonial expansion, and mindful of possessions beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>

<div class="sidenote">Napoleon’s
views as
to St.
Domingo
and
Louisiana.</div>

<p>Napoleon, as writers have shown, in negotiating for
and concluding the Peace of Amiens which gave him
respite from the sea power of Great Britain, had in view
the reconquest of St. Domingo where Toussaint L’Ouverture
had secured practical independence, and the recovery
of Louisiana. By secret bargain with Spain in 1800,
he had secured the retrocession of Louisiana; and, had
the arrangement been carried out and the French power
been firmly planted again at New Orleans and on the
Mississippi, a new impetus and a new motive would have
been given for French designs on Canada. But the losses
in the St. Domingo campaigns were heavy, and in regard
to Louisiana Napoleon had to reckon with the American
people. Realizing that his policy, if persisted in,
would draw the United States away from France and
towards Great Britain, he came, with some suddenness,
to the conclusion that the game was not worth the candle, <span class="sidenote">Abandonment of his American schemes.</span>
and selling in 1803 to the United States the great territory
on the line of the Mississippi which after all was not his
to sell, he put an end for ever to French aspirations for
recovering their North American dominions.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s decision set Canada free from any possible
danger of French conquest; but, at the same time, it <span class="sidenote">Danger to Canada from the United States.</span>
set him free also to renew war with Great Britain, and
cut short any tendency to more cordial relations between
Great Britain and the United States. The danger for
Canada now was that, either as the direct result of friendship
between France and the United States, or indirectly
through the incidents to which the maritime war between
France and Great Britain gave rise, war would take
place between Great Britain and the United States,
involving American invasion and not improbably American
conquest of Canada. Eventually, in 1812, war came to
pass. Once more England was called upon to fight
France and the United States at the same time; but in
this second war the Canadians, heart-whole in defending<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
their province against their rivals of old time, themselves
largely contributed to the saving of Canada.</p>

<p>The causes which led to the war of 1812 have been
noted in another book.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> One of the incidents which
<span class="sidenote">The incident of the <i>Leopard</i> and the <i>Chesapeake</i>.</span>
preluded it was the action of a British ship of war, the
<i>Leopard</i>, in firing on the American frigate <i>Chesapeake</i>
and carrying off four men, who were claimed as deserters
from the British navy. This high-handed proceeding
naturally caused the strongest resentment in the United
States, and raised the whole question of the right of search.
There was talk of invading Canada, which was answered
by calling out the Canadian militia; the Canadians
answered readily to the call; and shortly afterwards
a new Governor-General arrived in Canada, a man well
tried in war, Sir James Craig. On the 10th of August, <span class="sidenote">Sir James Craig appointed Governor-General of Canada.</span>
1807, General Prescott, still Governor-General of Canada,
though he had left in July, 1799, was delicately informed
by Lord Castlereagh, then Secretary of State, that it
was necessary to appoint a new Governor-General. The
terms of the letter were that Lord Castlereagh lamented
that circumstances required an arrangement to be made
which might interfere with Prescott’s emoluments. Sir
James Craig accordingly received his commission on the
last day of August, 1807, and landed at Quebec on the
18th of October, too ill to take the oaths of office until
the 24th of that month, when he took them in his bedroom.
Craig, though in failing health, governed Canada for four
years. Like his predecessors he was a distinguished
soldier. He was a Scotchman but was born at Gibraltar, <span class="sidenote">His previous career.</span>
where his father held the post of civil and military judge
in the fortress. He was born in 1748 and was only fifteen
years old when he joined the army in 1763, the year of
the great Peace. He was wounded at Bunker’s Hill;
in 1776 he went to Canada and commanded the advanced
guard of the forces which under Carleton’s command
drove the Americans out of Canada. He took part in
Burgoyne’s expedition, was twice wounded, was present<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
at Saratoga, and was chosen to carry home dispatches.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
Later in the war he served with distinction under Lord
Cornwallis in North Carolina. In 1794 he became a
major-general, and in 1795 he was sent to the Cape to
take it over from the Dutch. The Netherlands, recently
over-run by a French army under Pichegru, had been
transformed into the Batavian republic, and the Prince
of Orange, then a refugee in England, sent orders by the
British fleet under Admiral Elphinstone, which carried
Craig and his troops, that the British force should be
admitted as having come to protect the colony from
the French. The Dutch governor, however, was not
prepared to hand over his charge to British keeping.
Craig accordingly landed his troops at Simonstown, and
successfully attacked the Dutch at Muizenberg, but was
not able to occupy Capetown until the arrival of a force
from India, which had been ordered to co-operate, and
which was under the command of a senior officer, Sir
Alured Clarke, the late Lieutenant-Governor of Lower
Canada. On Clarke’s arrival the Dutch capitulated, and
Craig became the first British Governor of the Cape,
being succeeded in 1797 by a civilian, Lord Macartney.
He served about five years in India, being promoted to
be Lieutenant-General in 1801; and, after returning to
England in 1802, was sent in 1805 to the Mediterranean
in charge of an abortive expedition to Naples, in which
British and Russian troops were to combine against the
French. It ended in his transferring his force to Sicily,
where the Neapolitan court had taken refuge. He then
went home in ill health, and in 1807 went out to Canada.
His appointment was no doubt mainly due to his military
reputation, for war with the United States seemed
close at hand; but he was well qualified for it also by his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
wide experience of the colonies, and by the fact that,
like Prescott, he had already had a short term of colonial
administration. He left behind him at the Cape a good
record as governor, and but for the state of his health
seemed clearly the man for Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
beginning
of his administration.</div>

<p>In his first speech to the Legislature of Lower Canada
in January, 1808, Craig expressed his gratification at
meeting the members of the two Houses ‘in the exercise
of the noblest office to which the human mind can be
directed, that of legislating for a free people’, and he
added that he looked forward to the most perfect harmony
and co-operation between them and himself. His anticipations
were not fulfilled, and during the years of his
administration the inevitable struggle for further power
on the part of the elected representatives of the community
became accentuated. The session of 1808 lasted from
January to April. It was the last session of an existing
Parliament. No point of difference arose in this short
time between the Assembly and the Executive; but,
the Assembly having passed a Bill, undoubtedly right in
principle though directed against a particular individual,
that judges should be incapable of being elected to or
sitting in the House, the Bill was thrown out by the
Legislative Council. This caused ill feeling between the
two branches of the Legislature, and at the same time
the Assembly came into collision with one of the constituencies,
that of Three Rivers, by passing a resolution
which excluded from the House a Jew who had been
duly elected as member for Three Rivers and was promptly
re-elected. At the conclusion of the session a General
Election took place in May, but the Legislature was not
called together till April, 1809, and in the meantime
friction began between the governor and the popular
representatives.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Friction
between
the
governor
and the
Assembly.</div>

<p>In June, 1808, Craig dismissed certain gentlemen from
their appointments as officers in the town militia on
account of their connexion with the French opposition
paper <i>Le Canadien</i>. One of them, M. Panet, had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
Speaker of the House of Assembly in the late Parliament,
and when the new House met he was again chosen to be
Speaker, the choice being confirmed by the governor.
The House sat for five weeks in 1809, wrangling over the
same questions that had been prominent in the preceding
year, viz. the exclusion from the House of judges and
of members of the Jewish religion: it was then peremptorily
dissolved by the governor, who rated the
members as so many children for wasting time and
abusing their functions at a critical season of national
affairs. The election took place in the following October;
and, when the Legislature met in January, 1810, the
Assembly was composed of much the same representatives
as before, any change being rather against than in
favour of the governor. In his opening speech the
governor intimated that the Royal approval would be
given to any proper Bill passed by both Houses, rendering
the judges ineligible for seats in the Assembly. The
House of Assembly on their side, having passed a resolution
to the effect that any attempt on the part of the Executive
or the other branch of the Legislature to dictate to them
or censure their proceedings was a breach of their
privileges, went on to pass loyal addresses appropriate
to the fiftieth year of the King’s reign, their loyalty
being, perhaps, quickened by the strong reference which
had been made in the governor’s speech ‘to the high-sounded
resentment of America’, coupled with an assurance
that in the event of war Canada would receive ‘the
necessary support of regular troops in the confident
expectation of a cheerful exertion of the interior force
of the country’. There followed an Address to the
King and the Imperial Parliament, to which reference
has already been made, and in which the Assembly,
with many expressions of gratitude, intimated that the
prosperity of Lower Canada was now so great that they
could in that session pay all the expenses of the civil
government. This Address the governor promised to
lay before the King, though he pointed out that it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
unconstitutional in, among other points, ignoring the
Legislative Council. A Bill excluding the judges was
then passed and sent up to the Legislative Council, who
amended it by adding a clause which postponed its
effect until the next Parliament, whereupon the Assembly
passed a resolution excluding by name a certain judge
who had a seat in the House, and the governor, rightly
deeming their action in the matter to be unconstitutional,
on the 26th of February again dissolved Parliament.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Proceedings
taken by
the
governor
against
<i>Le Canadien</i>.</div>

<p>The French newspaper, <i>Le Canadien</i>, abounded weekly
in scurrilous abuse of the authorities. On the 17th of
March Craig took the strong step of seizing the printing
press and all the papers, and committing to prison
various persons connected with the paper, three of
whom had been members of the late House of Assembly.
He justified his action in a proclamation to the country
at large. The prisoners were released in the course of
the summer on the score of ill health or submission, with
the exception of one French Canadian named Bedard,
who refused to come to terms with the Executive and
was still in prison when the new Assembly, to which he
had been elected, met on the 12th of December, 1810.
The governor, in his masterful proceedings, had acted
under the authority of a temporary law entitled ‘an Act
for the better preservation of His Majesty’s Government,
as by law happily established in this province’. This
Act was now expiring, and in his opening address he
called attention to the necessity for renewing it. He
carried his point, the Act was renewed, and, in addition
to resolutions on the subject of Mr. Bedard’s imprisonment,
the Assembly did some useful legislative work
before the Legislature was prorogued on the 21st of March,
1811. Shortly after the prorogation Mr. Bedard was <span class="sidenote">Craig retires on ill health.</span>
released, and on the 19th of June, 1811, Sir James Craig
left Canada. He had long been in failing health, and in
the proclamation, in which he defended his seizure of
<i>Le Canadien</i> and those responsible for it, he had referred
pathetically to his life as ‘ebbing not slowly to its period<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
under the pressure of disease acquired in the service of
my country’. His resignation had been for some months
in the hands of the Government, and it was only in order
to suit their convenience that he put off his departure
to the date when it actually took place. He reached
England alive, but died in the following January in his <span class="sidenote">His death and character.</span>
sixty-second year. He was a man of conspicuous honesty
and of undoubted courage and firmness. He had a
soldier’s view as to discipline and subordination, which
made him peremptory as a governor, and his addresses
tended to be long-winded and dictatorial. But his
personal popularity was great, he was dignified, hospitable,
and open-handed, and he commanded respect even from
his political opponents and from those whom he put into
prison. He may well have been forgiven much not only
for his personal qualities, but also because his military
reputation was no small asset to Canada. His dealings
with the United States were fair and courteous, but
behind them was the known fact of his capacity and
experience as a soldier. He might dispute with those
whom he governed in the sphere of civil action, but in
the event of war they had in him a leader upon whom
they could rely. The Canadians too had reason to be <span class="sidenote">Prosperity of Canada under Sir James Craig.</span>
in the main satisfied with his rule, in that the years during
which Craig was governor were years of much prosperity.
It was at this time that, stimulated by Napoleon’s
attempts to cut off Great Britain from the Baltic trade
and by the Non Intercourse Acts of the United States, <span class="sidenote">Growth of the lumber trade.</span>
lumber became an important industry of Canada. It
was at this time too, at the beginning of November, 1809,
that a citizen of Montreal, John Molson, put the first
steamer on the St. Lawrence, her passage from Montreal <span class="sidenote">The first steamer on the St. Lawrence.</span>
to Quebec taking sixty-six hours, during thirty of which
she was at anchor. Craig himself contributed to improvement
of communication in Lower Canada by constructing <span class="sidenote">Road to the Eastern Townships.</span>
sixty miles of road which bore his name, and which
linked the Eastern Townships, then being settled largely
by immigrants from the United States, to the southern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
bank of the St. Lawrence over against Quebec. This
road, which was carried out by the troops under the
Quartermaster-General, afterwards Sir James Kempt,
Administrator of Canada, was, as Craig wrote to his
friend and secretary Ryland, much wanted ‘not merely
for the purpose of procuring us the necessary supplies
but for the purpose also of bringing the people to our
doors’:<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> and it resulted in the price of beef falling in
the Quebec market from 7½<i>d.</i> to 4½<i>d.</i> a lb.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> It gave an
outlet to Quebec to a fine agricultural district, and it
opened a direct route to Boston from the capital of
Canada.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Ryland’s
mission
to
England.</div>

<p>When Craig wrote these letters to Ryland, the latter
was in England. He had been sent by the governor to
lay the views of the latter upon the political situation
in Canada before the Home Government; and, reaching
England at the end of July, 1810, he was active in interviewing
ministers and supplying them verbally and by
written memoranda with first-hand information. Ryland
had gone out to America in 1781 as a paymaster in the
army during the War of Independence; and, returning
with Carleton at the end of the war, had been taken by
him to Canada as confidential secretary. He continued
to hold that office to successive governors for twenty
years, until 1813, when Sir George Prevost, who followed
Craig as Governor-General and with whom Ryland was
not in harmony, suggested that other arrangements
should be made for the secretaryship. Ryland then
resigned his office of governor’s secretary but remained
clerk to the Executive Council, living in the suburbs of
Quebec, until his death in 1838. He seems to have been
an able, honourable man, strongly opposed to the democratic
party in Lower Canada, to the French and Roman
Catholic section of the community. In England he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
brought into relations chiefly with Lord Liverpool, who
was Secretary of State for War and the Colonies<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> in the
Percival ministry, having succeeded Lord Castlereagh in
that office, and with the Under-Secretary of State, Robert
Peel. Peel was then beginning his public life, and
Ryland’s impression of him on his first interview was
that ‘though a very young man and but a few days in
office [he] appears to be very much <i>au fait</i> in matters
of public business’. A week or two later he wrote of
him as ‘a very elegant young man of fine talents, as I am
informed’, and very pleasing manners.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> With these
two ministers and with various other public men, including
George Canning, Ryland conferred or corresponded
during his stay in England, which lasted for the better
part of two years. On one occasion, soon after his
arrival, he was present at a Cabinet Council, being seated,
as we learn from the full account which he wrote to
Craig, between Percival and Lord Liverpool. He was
asked a large number of questions, including a query
as to the number of regular troops in Canada, and, as
the result, he appears to have formed a very poor opinion
of the knowledge and capacity of the ministry.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Craig’s
views
on the
political
situation
in Lower
Canada.</div>

<p>He had brought with him to England a very long
dispatch in which Craig had set out his views. Craig
estimated the population of Lower Canada at the time
when he wrote, May, 1810, at between 250,000 and
300,000 souls, out of whom he computed that no more
than 20,000 to 25,000 were English or Americans. The
remainder, the French Canadians, he represented as, in
the main, wholly alienated from the British section of
the community, French in religion, laws, language and
manners, and becoming more attracted to France and
more alienated from Great Britain, in proportion as the
power of France in Europe became more consolidated.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
The large mass of the people were, so he wrote, wholly
uneducated, following unscrupulous men, their leaders
in the country and in the House of Assembly. The
Roman Catholic priests were anti-English on grounds of
race and religion; their attachment to France had been
renewed since Napoleon made his concordat with the Pope;
and, being largely drawn from the lower orders of society,
and headed by a bishop who exercised more authority than
in the days of the old régime and who arrogated complete
independence of the civil government, they were hardly
even outwardly loyal to the British Crown. The growing
nationalist and democratic feeling was reflected and
embodied in the elected House of Assembly. When the
constitution was first granted, some few Canadian gentlemen
had come forward and been elected; but, at the
time when the governor wrote, the Canadian members of
the Assembly, who formed an overwhelming majority,
according to his account consisted of avocats and
notaries, shopkeepers and habitants, some of the last
named being unable either to read or write. The organ
of the party was the paper <i>Le Canadien</i>, which vilified
the Executive officers as ‘gens en place’, and aimed at
bringing the government into contempt.</p>

<p>To meet the evils which he deemed so great and
emphasized so strongly, Craig proposed that the existing
constitution should be either cancelled or suspended.
His view, as expressed in a letter to Ryland written in <span class="sidenote">Constitutional changes recommended.</span>
November, 1810,<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> was that it should be suspended
during the continuance of the war with France and for
five years afterwards, and that in this interval the former
government by means of a governor and a nominated
Legislative Council should be revived. He argued that
representative institutions had been prematurely granted,
before French Canadians were prepared for them; that
they had been demanded by the English section of the
inhabitants, not the French; and that at the time the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
best informed Canadians had been opposed to the change.
In the alternative, he discussed the reunion of the two
provinces, so as to leaven the Assembly with a larger
number of British members, though he did not advocate
this course; and the re-casting of the electoral divisions
in Lower Canada, so as to give more adequate representation
to those parts of the province, such as the
Eastern Townships, where the English-speaking element
could hold its own. In any case he pointed out the necessity
of enacting a property qualification for the members of
the Assembly, no such qualification being required under
the Act of 1791, although that Act prescribed a qualification
for the voters who elected the members. Craig
went on to urge, as Milnes had urged before him, that
the Royal supremacy should be exercised over the Roman
Catholic priesthood, additional salary being given to the
bishop, in consideration of holding his position under
the Crown, and the curés being given freehold in their
livings under appointment from the Crown. There was
a further point. The Sulpician seminary at Montreal
was possessed of large estates, and Craig considered this
clerical body to be dangerous in view of the fact that
it consisted largely of French emigrant priests. He
proposed therefore that the Crown should resume the
greater part of the lands.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Craig’s
views not
accepted
by the
Imperial
Government.</div>

<p>Ryland soon found that the ministry were not prepared
to face Parliament with any proposals for a constitutional
change in Canada, and that they were more inclined
to what he called ‘the namby-pamby system of conciliation’.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
They thought that it had been a mistake in the
first instance to divide Canada into two provinces, but
the only step which they now took was to procure a
somewhat superfluous opinion from the Attorney-General
to the effect that the Imperial Parliament could alter
the constitution of the provinces, or could reunite them
with one Council and Assembly; and a rather less self-evident
opinion that the governor could not redistribute<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
the electoral divisions of Lower Canada without being
authorized to do so by an Act either of the Imperial or
of the Colonial Legislature.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Critical
condition
of
England
at the
time of
Ryland’s
mission.</div>

<p>To Ryland the affairs of Canada were all in all; to
the ministry whom he deemed so weak, they were overshadowed
by events and difficulties at home and abroad,
compared with which the political questions which
troubled Lower Canada were insignificant, noteworthy
only as likely, if not carefully handled, to add to the
burden which was laid on the statesmen responsible for
the safe-keeping of the Empire. In 1809 Talavera had
been fought and hardly won, but it was the year also
of the disastrous expedition to Walcheren. In 1810,
behind the lines of Torres Vedras, Wellington was beginning
to turn the tide of French invasion in the Peninsula.
The next year saw Massena’s retreat, but at home the
political situation was complicated by the insanity of
the old King and the consequent necessity of declaring
a regency. In 1812, the year of Salamanca, Percival the
Prime Minister was assassinated, his place being taken
by Lord Liverpool, who, as long as Ryland was in England,
had been in charge of the colonies. In the same year,
war with the United States long threatened, came to pass.
These years were in England years of financial distress
and of widespread misery. William Cobbett giving voice
to the hungry discontent of the poor was fined and
imprisoned, and Ryland hoped that his fate would have
some effect in Canada.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p>Lord Liverpool, however, was very loyal to Craig,
though he did not support any such drastic measures
as the latter had suggested. At the end of July, 1811,
by which time Craig had left Canada, he wrote a letter
to him expressing the Prince Regent’s high approbation
of his general conduct in the administration of the government
of the North American provinces and the Prince’s
particular regret at the cause which had necessitated
his retirement. He wrote too to Craig’s successor, Sir<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
George Prevost, highly praising Ryland and expressing
a hope that he would be retained in his appointment. <span class="sidenote">Legal opinion as to patronage to appointments in the
Roman Catholic Church in Canada, and as to the Sulpician estates.</span>
The law officers of the Crown in England had been
consulted as to the Roman Catholic Church in Canada
in view of the governor’s proposals, and advised that so
much of the patronage of Roman Catholic benefices as
was exercised by the Bishop of Quebec under the French
Government had of right devolved on the Crown. On
the further question, whether the Crown had the right
of property in the estates of the Sulpician seminary at
Montreal, they advised that legally the Crown had the
right, inasmuch as the Sulpicians who remained in
Canada after the British conquest had no legal capacity
to hold lands apart from the parent body at Paris which
had since been dissolved, and had not obtained a licence
from the Crown to hold the estates; but the law officers,
seeing the hardship which would be involved in wholesale
confiscation of the lands after so many years of undisturbed
tenure, suggested that the question was one
for compromise or amicable arrangement. In the end
nothing was done in the matter in the direction of Craig’s
and Ryland’s views, and many years later, in 1840,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
by an ordinance of Lower Canada, the Sulpicians of
Montreal were incorporated under certain conditions and
confirmed in the possession of their estates.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sir James
Craig’s
administration.</div>

<p>It is not easy to form an accurate estimate of Sir
James Craig’s administration. His views and his methods
have been judged in the light of later history rather than
in that of the years which had gone before. It is somewhat
overlooked that at the beginning of the nineteenth
century the normal conditions of the world were conditions
of war not of peace, and that the governors of
colonies were as a rule soldiers whose first duty was the
military charge of possessions held by no very certain
tenure. The account usually given and received is that
Craig was an honest but mistaken man, tactless and
overbearing, trying to uphold an impossible system of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
bureaucratic despotism, instead of realizing the merits
of representative institutions and giving them full play.
The apology made for him has been that he was guided
by and saw with the eyes of a few rapacious officials,
who had no interest in the general welfare of the community.
‘The government, in fact,’ writes Christie,
‘was a bureaucracy, the governor himself little better
than a hostage, and the people looked upon and treated
as serfs and vassals by their official lords.’<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Constitutions and systems of government are good or
bad according to the kinds of people to which they are
applied, the stage of development which they have
reached, and the particular circumstances existing at
a given time inside and outside the land. It was only
with much hesitation that representative institutions
had been given to Canada; and one governor and
another, bearing in mind the conditions which had
preceded the War of Independence, had laid stress on
the necessity of having a strong Executive, and on the
growing danger of colonial democracy. They were not
ignorant or shortsighted men; they looked facts in the
face and argued from past experience in America. Again,
if the officials were incompetent placemen, out of sympathy
with the people, it was the governors who laid
stress on the necessity of filling official positions with first-rate
men and who occasionally took a strong line with
the men whom they did not consider to be adequate.
Moreover some of the officials, notably the judicial and
legal officers, placed themselves in opposition to the
local government and posed as defenders of the people.
Craig dispensed, for the time at any rate, with the services
of two law officers. One of them, Uniacke, who had <span class="sidenote">Uniacke.</span>
been in Nova Scotia, was made Attorney-General of
Lower Canada by Lord Liverpool, and, being considered
by the governor to be unfit for his duties, was sent on
leave to England in 1810 with a request that he should
be removed from his office. He subsequently returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
to his work in Canada. The other, James Stuart, became <span class="sidenote">James Stuart.</span>
a notable figure in Canadian history. He was the son
of a United Empire Loyalist, the rector of Kingston in
Ontario. He had been appointed Solicitor-General of
Lower Canada by Milnes in 1801, but after Craig’s arrival
ranged himself, as a member of the Assembly, in opposition
to the governor, and in 1809 was obliged to resign
his appointment. After some years of bitter opposition
to the government, he lived to become a leading advocate
of reunion of the two provinces, to be appointed Attorney-General,
to be impeached by the Assembly and again
deprived of his office, and finally to be appointed by
Lord Durham Chief Justice of Lower Canada and to be
created a baronet for his public services.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Upper Canada, where a young Lieutenant-Governor,
Francis Gore, from 1807 to 1811 carried on the
administration firmly and well, various holders of offices
opposed the government and tried to play the part of
popular leaders. Judge Thorpe has already been mentioned, <span class="sidenote">Thorpe and Willcocks.</span>
on the Bench and in the House of Assembly
a blatant and disloyal demagogue; another man of the
same kind was Wyatt the Surveyor-General, and another
Willcocks, sheriff of one of the districts, and owner or
nominal owner of a libellous newspaper, for the contents
of which the House of Assembly committed him to jail
on the ground of breach of privilege. These three men
were suspended from their appointments, and eventually
disappeared from Canada to make their voices heard in
England or in the United States; and the end of Willcocks
was to be killed fighting against his country in the
war of 1812. One thing is certain that in their official
positions they were disloyal to the government, and that
in their disloyalty they received no support from the
elected Assembly of Upper Canada. Gore had a difficulty
too with his Attorney-General, Firth, a man sent out
from England. Firth ended by returning to England
without leave and joining in misrepresentations against
the Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span></p>

<p>It may fairly be summed up that in the Canadas
many men were found in office who had been pitchforked
into appointments for which they were unsuited;
but that they were by no means invariably supporters
of the Executive against the representatives of the people,
nor were the governors their tools. On the contrary
there were constant cases of such officials opposing the
governors, while the governors in their turn stood out
conspicuously in opposition to the practice of appointing
men from outside to offices in Canada which required
special qualifications in addition to good character and
general capacity. But a distinction must be drawn
between Upper and Lower Canada. In Upper Canada
the voters and their nominees, however democratic, were,
with the exception of a few traitorous individuals,
intensely loyal to the British connexion. In Lower
Canada, on the other hand, the all-important race question
complicated the situation, and here Craig saw in the
French Canadians, who were also the democratic party,
the elements of disloyalty to Great Britain and <i>rapprochement</i>
with France. In August, 1808, he wrote <span class="sidenote">Craig’s opinion of the French Canadians.</span>
that the Canadians were French at heart; that, while
they did not deny the advantages which they enjoyed
under British rule, there would not be fifty dissentient
voices, if the proposition was made of their re-annexation
to France: and that the general opinion among the
English in Canada was that they would even join the
Americans if the latter were commanded by a French
officer. His views on this point were fully shared by
another man of clear head and sound judgement, Isaac
Brock. For reasons which have been given Craig seems <span class="sidenote">Real attitude of the French Canadians.</span>
to have exaggerated any danger of the kind. Republican
France, which attracted American sympathies, repelled
those of the French Canadians. France under Napoleon,
brought back to law and order and to at any rate the
outward conventionalities of religion, became more
attractive to the French Canadians, but at the same
time, in view of the Napoleonic despotism, it became<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
less attractive to the United States. But at no time
probably was there any real intention on the part
of the French Canadians to take any active step to
overthrow British supremacy. Certainly at no time was
there the slightest possibility of their changing their
status except by becoming absorbed in the United States.
They were as a whole an unthinking people, to whom
representative institutions and a free press were a novelty;
their leaders liked the words and phrases which they
had learnt from English-speaking demagogues or imported
from revolutionary France. Their priesthood was not
loyal, because it claimed to be independent of the civil
government, especially when it was the government of
a Protestant Power. The general aim was to see to
what uses the new privileges could be applied and how
much latitude would be given. The elected representatives
opposed the second chamber, the Legislative Council,
as much as they opposed the governor; they played with
edged tools, but it may be doubted whether at this early
stage of the proceedings they meant much more than
play.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, perhaps a fair judgement
upon Sir James Craig’s administration would be that he
took the Parliamentary situation in Lower Canada too
seriously, and did not give sufficient rope to the local
politicians. He reprimanded the Assembly when they
acted unconstitutionally, and dissolved them when they
did not do their work. The strong measures which he
adopted, and the repeated dissolutions, were a bad precedent
for the future: and the course which he recommended,
viz. suspension of the constitution, would, if
carried into effect, have been premature and unwise.
But for the moment the steps which he took were effective.
By his summary action in regard to the newspaper
<i>Le Canadien</i>, he showed that he had the ultimate power
and was not afraid to use it; and the result was that
the very law which gave the Executive extraordinary
powers was renewed by the Assembly which objected to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
those powers. Meanwhile Canada thrived, the governor
was personally respected, and repeated elections did no
one any harm. It was a time of danger from without
and unrest within, but many countries with admirable
constitutions have fared much worse than did Lower
Canada under the rule of a strong soldier confronted by
a recalcitrant Assembly.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by a man of wholly different type,
Sir George Prevost, who endeared himself greatly to the
French Canadians; but internal differences were soon to
be overshadowed by foreign invasion, for in one year to
the day from the date when Sir James Craig left Canada,
Madison, President of the United States, issued a proclamation
which began the war of 1812.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="hang15 fs80">DEFINITIVE TREATY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
BETWEEN HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY AND THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, SIGNED AT PARIS,
THE 3<span class="allsmcap">RD</span> OF SEPTEMBER, 1783.</p>
</div>

<p>In the Name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity.
It having pleased the Divine Providence to dispose the
hearts of the Most Serene and Most Potent Prince, George
the Third, by the Grace of God, King of Great Britain, France
and Ireland, Defender of the Faith, Duke of Brunswick and
Lunenburg, Arch-Treasurer and Prince Elector of the Holy
Roman Empire, &amp;c., and of the United States of America,
to forget all past misunderstandings and differences that
have unhappily interrupted the good correspondence and
friendship which they mutually wish to restore: and to
establish such a beneficial and satisfactory intercourse between
the 2 Countries, upon the ground of reciprocal advantages
and mutual convenience, as may promote and secure to both
perpetual Peace and Harmony; and having for this desirable
end already laid the foundation of Peace and Reconciliation by
the Provisional Articles signed at Paris, on the 30th of November,
1782, by the Commissioners empowered on each part;
which Articles were agreed to be inserted in, and to constitute,
the Treaty of Peace proposed to be concluded between the
Crown of Great Britain and the said United States, but
which Treaty was not to be concluded until terms of Peace
should be agreed upon between Great Britain and France,
and His Britannic Majesty should be ready to conclude such
Treaty accordingly; and the Treaty between Great Britain
and France having since been concluded, His Britannic
Majesty and the United States of America, in order to carry
into full effect the Provisional Articles above-mentioned,
according to the tenor thereof, have constituted and appointed,
that is to say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>His Britannic Majesty, on his part, David Hartley, Esq.,
Member of the Parliament of Great Britain; and the said United
States, on their part, John Adams, Esq., late a Commissioner
of the United States of America at the Court of Versailles,
late Delegate in Congress from the State of Massachusetts,
and Chief Justice of the said State and Minister Plenipotentiary
of the said United States to Their High Mightinesses
the States General of the United Netherlands; Benjamin
Franklin, Esq., late Delegate in Congress from the State of
Pennsylvania, President of the Convention of the said State,
and Minister Plenipotentiary from the United States of
America at the Court of Versailles; John Jay, Esq., late
President of Congress and Chief Justice of the State of New
York, and Minister Plenipotentiary from the said United
States at the Court of Madrid; to be the plenipotentiaries
for the concluding and signing the present Definitive Treaty:
who, after having reciprocally communicated their respective
Full Powers, have agreed upon and confirmed the following
Articles:</p>

<p>Art. I. His Britannic Majesty acknowledges the said
United States, viz., New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay,
Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New
York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, to be
Free, Sovereign and Independent States; that he treats
with them as such; and for himself, his Heirs and Successors,
relinquishes all claims to the government, propriety and
territorial rights of the same, and every part thereof.</p>

<p>II. And that all disputes which might arise in future
on the subject of the Boundaries of the said United States
may be prevented, it is hereby agreed and declared, that the
following are and shall be their Boundaries, viz., from the
North-West Angle of Nova Scotia, viz., that Angle which is
formed by a line drawn due North, from the source of St. Croix
River to the Highlands, along the said Highlands which
divide those Rivers that empty themselves into the River
St. Lawrence from those which fall into the Atlantic Ocean,
to the North-westernmost head of Connecticut River; thence
down along the middle of that River to the 45th degree of
North latitude; from thence by a line due West on said
latitude until it strikes the River Iroquois or Cataraquy;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
thence along the middle of the said River into Lake Ontario;
through the middle of said Lake, until it strikes the communication
by water between that Lake and Lake Erie;
thence along the middle of said communication into Lake
Erie; through the middle of said Lake until it arrives at the
water-communication between that Lake and Lake Huron;
thence along the middle of said water-communication into
the Lake Huron; thence through the middle of said Lake
to the water-communication between that Lake and Lake
Superior; thence through Lake Superior, Northward of the
Isles Royal and Phelipeaux, to the Long Lake; thence
through the middle of said Long Lake, and the water-communication
between it and the Lake of the Woods, to the
said Lake of the Woods; thence through the said Lake to
the most North-western point thereof, and from thence on
a due West course to the River Mississippi; thence by a line
to be drawn along the middle of the said River Mississippi,
until it shall intersect the Northernmost part of the 31st
degree of North latitude. South by a line to be drawn due
East from the determination of the line last mentioned, in
the latitude of 31 degrees North of the Equator, to the middle
of the River Apalachicola or Catahouche; thence along the
middle thereof to its junction with the Flint River; thence
straight to the head of St. Mary’s River, and thence down
along the middle of St. Mary’s River to the Atlantic Ocean,
East by a line to be drawn along the middle of the River
St. Croix, from its mouth in the Bay of Fundy to its source;
and from its source directly North to the aforesaid Highlands,
which divide the rivers that fall into the Atlantic Ocean from
those which fall into the River St. Lawrence: comprehending
all islands within 20 leagues of any part of the shores of the
United States, and lying between lines to be drawn due
East from the points where the aforesaid boundaries between
Nova Scotia on the one part, and East Florida on the other,
shall respectively touch the Bay of Fundy, and the Atlantic
Ocean; excepting such Islands as now are, or heretofore
have been, within the limits of the said Province of Nova
Scotia.</p>

<p>III. It is agreed that the People of the United States
shall continue to enjoy unmolested the right to take Fish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
of every kind on the Grand Bank and on all the other Banks
of Newfoundland; also in the Gulph of St. Lawrence, and
at all other places in the Sea, where the Inhabitants of both
Countries used at any time heretofore to fish. And also
that the Inhabitants of the United States shall have liberty
to take fish of every kind on such part of the Coast of Newfoundland
as British Fishermen shall use, (but not to dry
or cure the same on that Island,) and also on the Coasts,
Bays, and Creeks of all other of His Britannic Majesty’s
Dominions in America; and that the American Fishermen
shall have liberty to dry and cure fish in any of the unsettled
Bays, Harbours, and Creeks of Nova Scotia, Magdalen Islands
and Labrador, so long as the same shall remain unsettled;
but so soon as the same, or either of them, shall be settled,
it shall not be lawful for the said Fishermen to dry or cure
fish at such Settlement, without a previous agreement for
that purpose with the Inhabitants, Proprietors, or Possessors
of the ground.</p>

<p>IV. It is agreed, that Creditors on either side shall meet
with no lawful impedimenta to the recovery of the full
value in sterling money of all bonâ fide debts heretofore
contracted.</p>

<p>V. It is agreed, that the Congress shall earnestly recommend
it to the legislatures of the respective states to provide
for the restitution of all estates, rights and properties which
have been confiscated, belonging to real British subjects;
and also of the estates, rights and properties of persons resident
in districts in the possession of his Majesty’s arms, and who
have not borne arms against the said United States; and
that persons of any other description shall have free liberty
to go to any part or parts of any of the Thirteen United
States, and therein to remain twelve months unmolested in
their endeavours to obtain the restitution of such of their
estates, rights and properties as may have been confiscated;
and that Congress shall also earnestly recommend to the
several states, a reconsideration and revision of all acts or
laws regarding the premises, so as to render the said laws
or acts perfectly consistent, not only with justice and equity,
but with that spirit of conciliation, which, on the return of
the blessings of peace, should universally prevail. And that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
Congress shall also earnestly recommend to the several states,
that the estates, rights and properties of such last-mentioned
persons shall be restored to them, they refunding to any
persons who may be now in possession the bonâ fide price
(where any has been given) which such persons may have
paid on purchasing any of the said lands, rights or properties,
since the confiscation.</p>

<p>And it is agreed, that all persons who have any interest
in confiscated lands, either by debts, marriage settlements or
otherwise, shall meet with no lawful impediment in the
prosecution of their just rights.</p>

<p>VI. That there shall be no future confiscations made, nor
any prosecutions commenced against any person or persons,
for or by reason of the part which he or they may have taken
in the present war; and that no person shall on that account
suffer any future loss or damage either in his person, liberty
or property, and that those who may be in confinement on
such charges at the time of the ratification of the Treaty in
America, shall be immediately set at liberty, and the prosecutions
so commenced be discontinued.</p>

<p>VII. There shall be a firm and perpetual Peace between
His Britannic Majesty and the said States, and between the
Subjects of the one and the Citizens of the other, wherefore
all hostilities both by sea and land shall from henceforth
cease: all Prisoners on both sides shall be set at liberty,
and His Britannic Majesty shall with all convenient speed,
and without causing any destruction, or carrying away any
Negroes or other property of the American Inhabitants,
withdraw all his Armies, Garrisons and Fleets from the said
United States, and from every Port, Place, and Harbour
within the same; leaving in all Fortifications the American
Artillery that may be therein: and shall also order and
cause all Archives, Records, Deeds, and Papers belonging
to any of the said States, or their Citizens which in the course
of the War may have fallen into the hands of his Officers,
to be forthwith restored and delivered to the proper States
and Persons to whom they belong.</p>

<p>VIII. The navigation of the River Mississippi, from its source
to the Ocean, shall for ever remain free and open to the Subjects
of Great Britain and the Citizens of the United States.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span></p>

<p>IX. In case it should so happen that any Place or Territory
belonging to Great Britain, or to the United States, should
have been conquered by the arms of either, from the other,
before the arrival of the said Provisional Articles in America,
it is agreed that the same shall be restored without difficulty,
and without requiring any compensation.</p>

<p>X. The solemn Ratifications of the present Treaty, expedited
in good and due form, shall be exchanged between
the Contracting Parties in the space of 6 months, or sooner
if possible, to be computed from the day of the signature
of the present Treaty.</p>

<p>In witness whereof, we, the undersigned, their Ministers
Plenipotentiary, have in their name, and in virtue of our
Full Powers, signed with our Hands the present definitive
Treaty, and caused the Seals of our Arms to be affixed thereto,</p>

<p class="pbot2">Done at Paris, this 3rd day of September, in the year of
our Lord, 1783.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX_II">APPENDIX II<br />
<span class="fs80">THE BOUNDARY LINE OF CANADA</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The
North-Eastern
boundary.</div>

<p>On the North-Eastern side, the Treaty of 1783 prescribed
the boundary as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>‘From the North-West angle of Nova Scotia, viz., that
angle which is formed by a line drawn due North; from
the source of St. Croix river to the Highlands; along the
said Highlands which divide those rivers that empty
themselves into the river St. Lawrence from those which
fall into the Atlantic Ocean, to the North-Westernmost
head of Connecticut river; ... East by a line to be
drawn along the middle of the river St. Croix, from its
mouth in the Bay of Fundy to its source, and from its
source directly North to the aforesaid Highlands, which
divide the rivers that fall into the Atlantic Ocean from
those which fall into the river St. Lawrence; comprehending
all islands within twenty leagues of any part of the shores
of the United States, and lying between lines to be drawn
due East from the points where the aforesaid boundaries
between Nova Scotia on the one part, and East Florida
on the other, shall respectively touch the Bay of Fundy
and the Atlantic Ocean, excepting such islands as now
are or heretofore have been within the limits of the said
province of Nova Scotia.’</p>
</div>

<p>So far as these words refer to the sea boundary of the
United States no difficulty arose, except in the Bay of Fundy.
East Florida was ceded to Spain by Great Britain at the
same time that the treaty with the United States was signed,
and therefore the boundary line in the South had no further
concern for the English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
border
land
between
Acadia
and New
England.</div>

<p>The North-East had been the border land between Acadia
and the New England States. In old days, as was inevitable,
there had been constant disputes between French and English
as to the boundary between Acadia and New England, while
Acadia still belonged to France; and, after the Treaty of
Utrecht had given Acadia to Great Britain, as to the boundary
between Acadia and Canada. When, by the Peace of 1763,
Canada was ceded to Great Britain, the question of boundaries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
ceased to have any national importance; and no further
difficulty, except as between British Provinces, arose until
the United States became an independent nation. Then it
became necessary to draw an international frontier line,
which as a matter of fact had never yet been drawn. There
seems to have been a more or less honest attempt, with the help
of maps which were, as might have been expected, inaccurate,
to adopt a line for which there was some authority in the
past, instead of evolving a wholly new frontier; and the
result of looking to the past was eventually to fix a boundary
which was in no sense a natural frontier.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The river
St. Croix
taken in
1763 as
the
boundary
of Nova
Scotia
and hence
adopted
as the
boundary
line in the
Treaty of
1783.</div>

<p>The river St. Croix had always been a landmark in the
history of colonization in North America. It was the scene
of the first settlement by De Monts and Champlain; and,
when Sir William Alexander in 1621 received from the King
the famous grant of Nova Scotia, the grant was defined as
extending to</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘the river generally known by the name of St. Croix
and to the remotest springs, or source, from the Western
side of the same, which empty into the first mentioned
river’,</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Later, the French claim on behalf of Acadia extended as far
as the Penobscot river, if not to the Kennebec; but after the
Treaty of Utrecht, the claims of Massachusetts to the country
up to the St. Croix river were allowed in 1732;<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> and in 1763,
after the Peace of Paris, the St. Croix river was, in the Commission
to the Governor of Nova Scotia, designated as the
boundary of the province, the following being the terms of
the Commission:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>‘Although Our said province has anciently extended,
and does of right extend, so far as the river Pentagoet or
Penobscot, it shall be bounded by a line drawn from Cape
Sable across the entrance of the Bay of Fundy to the
mouth of the river St. Croix, by the said river to its source,
and by a line drawn due North from thence to the Southern
boundary of Our Colony of Quebec.’</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Accordingly the river St. Croix was designated as the international
boundary in the Treaty of 1783.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Doubt as
to the
identity
of the
St. Croix
river.</div>

<p>But then the question arose which was the St. Croix river.
Between 1763 and 1783 attempts had been made to identify
it, but without success, for at least three rivers flowing into
Passamaquoddy Bay were each claimed as the St. Croix.
After the Peace of 1783, the dispute continued, and eventually
the further Treaty of 19th of November, 1794, known from
the name of the American statesman who negotiated it in
London as Jay’s Treaty, provided in the Fifth Article that <span class="sidenote">Commission appointed under the Treaty of 1794 to identify the river.</span>
the question should be left to the final decision of three
Commissioners, one to be appointed by the British Government,
one by that of the United States, and a third by
the two Commissioners themselves. The article provided
that</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘the said Commissioners shall by a Declaration under
their hands and seals decide what river is the river
St. Croix intended by the treaty. The said Declaration
shall contain a description of the said river and shall
particularize the latitude and the longitude of its mouth
and its source.’</p>
</div>

<p>In August, 1795, the Treaty was ratified by Washington
as President of the United States; and, in 1796, the Commissioners
began their work, the third Commissioner being an
American lawyer. The work was not concluded until another
explanatory article had been, on the 15th of March, 1798,
signed on behalf of the two Governments, relieving the
Commissioners from the duty of particularizing the latitude
and longitude of the source of the St. Croix, provided that
they described the river in such other manner as they judged
expedient, and laying down that the point ascertained and
described to be the source should be marked by a monument
to be erected and maintained by the two Governments.
Eventually, on the 25th of October, 1798, the Commissioners,
who had discharged their duties with conspicuous fairness
and ability, gave their award. They identified the Scoodic <span class="sidenote">The St. Croix river determined in 1798.</span>
river, as it was then called, with the St. Croix of Champlain;
they selected the Eastern or Northern branch of the river
as the boundary line in preference to the South-Western,
thereby including in American territory a considerable area
which the English had claimed; they marked beyond
further dispute the point which was thereafter to be held<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
to be the source of the St. Croix; but they did not demarcate
the actual boundary line down the course of the river.</p>

<p>From the source of the St. Croix, according to the words of
the Treaty of 1783, which have been already quoted, a line
was to be drawn due North to the Highlands which formed <span class="sidenote">The Maine Boundary question.</span>
the water parting between the streams running into the
St. Lawrence and those running into the Atlantic Ocean,
and this line was supposed to form the North-West angle
of Nova Scotia. No provision was made in the Treaty of
1794 for determining the boundary North of the source of the
St. Croix river, and the labours of the St. Croix Commission
were confined to identifying that river from the mouth to
the source. A far more serious and more prolonged controversy
arose over the territory to the North of the source,
threatening to bring war between Great Britain and the
United States, and not settled for sixty years.</p>

<p>As in the case of the St. Croix, the framers of the Treaty
of 1783, in specifying a line drawn due North from the source
of that river, to meet the Highlands which parted the basin
of the St. Lawrence from that of the Atlantic, had recourse
to past history and used definitions already in existence. <span class="sidenote">The old definitions of the boundary.</span>
Nova Scotia, as granted to Sir William Alexander, was,
according to the terms of the charter, bounded from the
source of the St. Croix</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘by an imaginary straight line which is conceived to
extend through the land, or run Northward to the nearest
bay, river, or stream emptying into the great river of
Canada’.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Royal Proclamation of 1763, which constituted the
province of Quebec after the peace signed in that year, defined
the Southern boundary of Quebec as passing</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘along the Highlands which divide the rivers that empty
themselves into the said river St. Lawrence from those
which fall into the sea’.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The Quebec Act of 1774 again defined the Southern boundary
of Quebec as</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘along the Highlands which divide the rivers that empty
themselves into the river St. Lawrence from those which
fall into the sea, to a point in 45 degrees of Northern latitude
on the Eastern bank of the River Connecticut’.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span></p>

<p class="noindent">In the Commission to the Governor of Nova Scotia issued
in 1763, the Western boundary of Nova Scotia from the source
of the St. Croix was defined</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘by a line drawn due North from thence to the Southern
boundary of Our colony of Quebec’.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Therefore the Treaty of 1783, in defining the international
line as a line drawn from the source of the St. Croix</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘directly North to the aforesaid Highlands which divide
the rivers that fall into the Atlantic Ocean from those
which fall into the river St. Lawrence’,</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">used the previous definitions of the Western boundary of
Nova Scotia and the Southern boundary of Quebec.</p>

<p>There were only two new points in the wording of the
Treaty. The first was that the sea was defined as the Atlantic
Ocean, thereby excluding the Bay of Chaleurs, and possibly
the Bay of Fundy also, which was, in the Treaty, at any rate
according to the British contention, treated as separate from
the Atlantic Ocean. The second was the importation of
the words ‘the North-West angle of Nova Scotia.’ It was <span class="sidenote">The ‘North-West angle of Nova Scotia’.</span>
obvious that wherever the Western boundary of Nova Scotia
met the Southern boundary of Quebec there must be such an
angle, but the Treaty spoke of it as a fixed starting point from
whence to draw the boundary line; it assumed that this
angle rested on highlands which divided the waters that
flowed into the Atlantic from those which were tributaries
of the St. Lawrence; and it assumed also that it would be
reached by a due North line from the source of the St. Croix
river. So the inaccurate maps of the day testified, and so
paper boundaries, already recognized, prescribed. When,
however, the matter was put to the test of actual geography,
it was found that a line drawn due North from the source
of the St. Croix nowhere intersected a water parting between
the St. Lawrence basin and that of the Atlantic Ocean. The
sources of the rivers which run into the Atlantic were found
to be far to the West of the Northern line from the St. Croix
river, to the West of that line even if it had been drawn from
the source of the South-Western branch of the St. Croix,
and not, as the St. Croix Commission had drawn it, from the
source of its more easterly branch. It was evident that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
earlier documents, which the Treaty of 1783 had followed,
were based upon inaccurate information and that it had
never been realized that the source of the St. John river,
beyond which would naturally be sought the head waters of
the streams running into the Atlantic, lay so far to the West,
as is actually the case.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
terms of
the 1783
Treaty
were not
in accord
with
actual
facts.</div>

<p>It was therefore physically impossible to mark out a
boundary in accordance with the terms of the Treaty. If
the due Northern line was adhered to, the Highlands mentioned
by the Treaty could not be reached. If those Highlands
were adhered to, the due Northern line must be abandoned.
In either case the North-Western angle of Nova Scotia,
instead of being a fixed starting point, was an unknown
factor, an abstraction which could only be given a real
existence by bargain and agreement. The matter was one
of vital importance to Great Britain, for it involved the
preservation or abandonment of communication between
the Maritime Provinces and Canada, all important in winter
time when the mouth of the St. Lawrence was closed. The
direct North line cut the St. John river slightly to the west
of the Grand Falls on that river; and, had it been prolonged
in the same direction, searching for Highlands till the St.
Lawrence was nearly reached, Canada and New Brunswick
would have been almost cut off from each other. The longer
the controversy went on, the more clearly this result was
seen by the Americans as well as by the English, hence the
bitterness of the dispute and the tenacity with which either
party maintained their position and accentuated their claims.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Attempt
at settlement
in
1803.</div>

<p>On the 12th of May, 1803, a Convention was signed between
Great Britain and the United States providing that the
dispute should be left to the decision of an International
Commission constituted in precisely the same manner as the
St. Croix Commission had been constituted; but the Convention
was never ratified, and the points at issue were still
outstanding when the negotiations were set on foot which <span class="sidenote">The second American war.</span>
ended in the Treaty of Ghent at the close of the second war
between the two nations. During the war formal possession
was taken on behalf of Great Britain of the country between
the Penobscot river and New Brunswick, which included the
area under dispute, a proclamation to that effect being issued<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
at Halifax on the 21st of September, 1814;<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> but at the date
of the proclamation negotiations for peace were already
proceeding, and the only basis on which the Americans
would treat was the restitution of the status quo ante bellum,
proposals for an adjustment of the boundary between New
Brunswick and Massachusetts,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> of which Maine then formed
part, being treated as a demand for cession of territory
belonging to the United States. On the British side it was <span class="sidenote">The British Contention.</span>
maintained that the line claimed by the Americans</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘by which the direct communication between Halifax and
Quebec becomes interrupted, was not in contemplation of
the British Plenipotentiaries who concluded the Treaty of
1783’,<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and in a later letter, replying to the American representatives,
the British negotiators wrote<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘the British Government never required that all that
portion of the State of Massachusetts intervening between
the Province of New Brunswick and Quebec should be
ceded to Great Britain, but only that small portion of
unsettled country which interrupts the communication
between Halifax and Quebec, there being much doubt
whether it does not already belong to Great Britain’.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The inference to be drawn from the correspondence is that,
on the strict wording of the Treaty of 1783, apart from the
intention of those who negotiated it, the American claim was
recognized to be stronger than the British.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Treaty of
Ghent.</div>

<p>The Treaty of Ghent was signed on the 24th of December,
1814, and the Fifth Article provided that two Commissioners
should be appointed to locate the North-West angle of Nova
Scotia as well as the North-Westernmost head of the Connecticut
river, between which two points the Treaty of 1783
provided that the dividing line along the Highlands was to
be drawn. A map of the boundary was to be made, and the
latitude and longitude of the North-West angle and of the
head of the Connecticut were to be particularized. If the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
Commissioners agreed, their report was to be final; but if
they disagreed, they were to report to their respective governments,
and some friendly sovereign or state was to arbitrate
between them. The Commission first met in 1816, much <span class="sidenote">A Boundary Commission appointed.</span>
time was taken up in surveying the North line from the source
of the St. Croix to the watershed of the St. Lawrence, and it
was not until 1821 that the two representatives, having
failed to agree, gave distinct awards, the British Commissioner <span class="sidenote">The Commissioners disagree.</span>
placing the North-West angle at the Highlands known as
Mars Hill nearly 40 miles south of the St. John river, and the
American Commissioner locating it nearly 70 miles north of
that river, either Commissioner adopting the extreme claim
put forward by his side.</p>

<p>In view of the divergence between the two reports, it
was necessary, in accordance with the terms of the Treaty of
Ghent, to submit the matter to arbitration; but this step
was not taken until yet another Convention had been signed
on the 29th of September, 1827, providing that new statements <span class="sidenote">The Convention of 1827.</span>
of the case on either side should be drawn up for submission
to the arbitrator. It was laid down that the basis
of the statements should be two specified maps, one of which
was referred to as the map used in drawing up the original
Treaty of 1783. The inaccuracies in this map, Mitchell’s
map, had been the origin of all the difficulties which had
subsequently arisen. The King of the Netherlands was <span class="sidenote">Award given by the King of the Netherlands as Arbitrator.</span>
selected to arbitrate. In 1830 the statements were laid
before him, and in January, 1831, he gave his award. It
was to the effect that it was impossible, having regard either
to law or to equity, to adopt either of the lines proposed by
the two contending parties, and that a compromise should be
accepted which was defined in the award. The line which
the king proposed was more favourable to the Americans <span class="sidenote">The award not accepted by the Americans.</span>
than to the English, but the Americans declined to consent
to it, on the ground that, while the arbitrator might accept
either of the two lines which were presented for arbitration,
he was not empowered to fix a third and new boundary.</p>

<p>Thus this troublesome matter was still left outstanding,
and yet the necessity for a settlement was more pressing
than ever. The new state of Maine maintained the American
claim with more pertinacity and less inclination to compromise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
than the Government of the United States had
shown; the United States Government was ready to accept
a conventional line, but Maine objected, and meanwhile the
result of the uncertainty and delay was that the backwoodsmen
of Maine and New Brunswick were coming to blows.
About the beginning of 1839 the disputes in the region of the <span class="sidenote">Collision in the Aroostook region.</span>
Aroostook river nearly brought on war between the two
nations, which was only averted by the mediation of General
Winfield Scott then commanding the American forces on
the frontier. Immediately afterwards two British Commissioners,
Colonel Mudge and Mr. Featherstonhaugh, were
deputed to survey the debatable territory and reported in
April, 1840,<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> their report being followed by a survey on the
part of the American Government. At length, on the 9th of
August, 1842, Daniel Webster then Secretary of State for the
United States, and Lord Ashburton, sent out as special <span class="sidenote">The Ashburton Treaty.

Final settlement of the Maine boundary question.</span>
Commissioner from Great Britain, concluded the Treaty of
Washington, which put an end to the long and dangerous
controversy. By the First Article of that Treaty the present
boundary was fixed; the North line from the monument at
the head of the St. Croix river was followed to the point
where it intersected the St. John; the middle of the main
channel of that river was then taken as far as the mouth of
its tributary the St. Francis; thence the middle of the channel
of the St. Francis up to the outlet of the Lake Pohenagamook;
from which point the line was drawn in a South-Westerly
direction to the dividing Highlands and the head of the
Connecticut river until the 45th degree of North latitude was
reached. The boundary was subsequently surveyed and
marked out, and upon the 28th of June, 1847, the final results
were reported and the matter was at an end.</p>

<p>The existing boundary is on the whole more favourable to
Great Britain than the line which the King of the Netherlands
proposed and the Americans rejected; but notwithstanding,
Lord Ashburton’s settlement has always been regarded in
Canada as having given to the United States territory to which
Great Britain had an undoubted claim. The fault, however,
was not with Lord Ashburton but with the wording of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
original Treaty of 1783; and that treaty, as has been shown,
was based on such geographical information as there was to
hand, accepted at the time in good faith, but subsequently
proved to be incorrect. It should be added that by the
Third Article of the Ashburton Treaty the navigation of the
river St. John was declared to be free and open to both
nations, and that the settlement of the international boundary
was followed by an adjustment of the frontier between Canada
and New Brunswick. The dispute between the two provinces <span class="sidenote">Settlement of the boundary between the province of Quebec and that of New Brunswick.</span>
was, at the suggestion of the Imperial Government, eventually
referred to two arbitrators, one chosen by each province,
with an umpire selected by the arbitrators themselves. The
award was given in 1851, and in the same year its terms were
embodied in an Imperial Act of Parliament</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘for the settlement of the boundaries between the provinces
of Canada and New Brunswick’.</p>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">The
International
boundary
in the
Bay of
Fundy.</div>

<p>In the Bay of Fundy the boundary line between British
and American territory was, by the terms of the 1783 Treaty,
to be drawn due East from the mouth of the St. Croix river,
assigning to the United States all islands within twenty
leagues of the shore to the South of the line,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘excepting such islands as now are or heretofore have been
within the limits of the said province of Nova Scotia.’</p>
</div>

<p>Here was a further ground of dispute, touching the ownership
of the islands in Passamaquoddy Bay. Geographically
they would belong to the United States, unless they could
be shown to have been within the limits of Nova Scotia.
The Convention of 1803, which has already been mentioned
as never having been ratified, in the First Article prescribed
the boundary; and the Treaty of Ghent in the Fourth Article
referred the matter to two Commissioners on precisely the
same terms as were adopted by the next Article of the Treaty
in the case of the North-West angle controversy, i.e., each
nation was to appoint an arbitrator, and, if the two arbitrators
failed to agree, separate reports were to be made to the two
governments, and the final decision was to be left to some
friendly sovereign or state. Fortunately the two arbitrators
came to an agreement, delivering their award on the 24th of
November, 1817. Three little islands in the Bay of Passamaquoddy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
named Moose Island, Dudley Island, and Frederick
Island, were allotted to the United States, and the rest of
the islands in the bay, together with the island of Grand
Manan, lying further out in the Bay of Fundy, were assigned
to Great Britain. The actual channel, however, was not
delimited; and though many years afterwards, under a Convention
of 1892, Commissioners were appointed for the purpose,
they failed to come to a complete agreement; this small
question therefore between the two nations is still awaiting
settlement under the Treaty for the delimitation of International
Boundaries between Canada and the United States which
was signed on 11th April, 1908.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">The line

head of

river to

<p>From the point where the boundary line struck the North-Westernmost
head of the Connecticut River, the Treaty of
1783 provided that it should be carried</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘down along the middle of that river to the forty-fifth
degree of North latitude, from thence by a line due West
on said latitude until it strikes the river Iroquois or

</div>

<p class="noindent">Iroquois or Cataraquy was the name given to the St. Lawrence
between Montreal and Lake Ontario, and the First
Article of Lord Ashburton’s Treaty, identifying the North-Westernmost
head of the Connecticut River with a river
called Hall’s Stream, re-affirmed in somewhat different words
the provision of the older Treaty as to this section of the
boundary. Here there was no dispute. The line had already
been laid down in the Proclamation of 1763 and the Quebec
Act of 1774. In the words of the Ashburton Treaty it was
the line</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘which has been known and understood to be the line of
actual division between the States of New York and
Vermont on one side and the British province of Canada on
the other’.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The line

<p>From the point where the 45th parallel intersected the

carried up the middle of the rivers and lakes to the water
communication between Lake Huron and Lake Superior,
with the necessary result that Lake Michigan was entirely
excluded from Canada. By the Sixth Article of the Treaty
of Ghent two Commissioners were to be appointed to settle
doubts as to what was the middle of the waterway and to
which of the two nations the various Islands belonged:
and, as in other cases, if the Commissioners disagreed, they
were to report to their respective governments with a view
to arbitration by a neutral power. A joint award was given,<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
signed at Utica on the 18th of June, 1822, the boundary
being elaborately specified and the report being accompanied
by a series of maps.</p>

said Lake of the Woods, thence through the said lake to
the most North-Western point thereof’.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Under the Sixth Article of the Treaty of Ghent the Commissioners
defined the frontier line well into the strait between
Lakes Huron and Superior, but stopped short of the Sault
St. Marie, at a point above St. Joseph’s Island and below
St. George’s or Sugar Island. Here they considered that
their labours under the Sixth Article terminated. But the
next Article of the Treaty of Ghent provided that the same
two Commissioners should go on to determine</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘that part of the boundary between the dominions of the
two powers, which extends from the water communication
between Lake Huron and Lake Superior to the most North-Western

<p class="noindent">Comparing these words with the terms of the 1783 Treaty,
it will be noticed that mention of the Long Lake is eliminated, <span class="sidenote">Nonexistence of the ‘Long Lake’.</span>
as it had been discovered in the meantime that the Long

the Commissioners were not at one. Accordingly on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
23rd of October, 1826,<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> they presented an elaborate joint
report showing the points on which they had come to an
agreement, and those on which they were at variance, with
their respective recommendations. As to a great part of
the line they were in accord, and especially they defined by
latitude and longitude the most North-Western point of the <span class="sidenote">The ‘most North-Western point of the Lake of the Woods’ determined.</span>
Lake of the Woods, but they wholly disagreed as to the
ownership of St. George’s or Sugar Island in the strait between
Lake Huron and Lake Superior, and also as to the line to be
taken from a point towards the Western end of Lake Superior<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
to the Lac de Pluie or Rainy Lake. They made, however, on
either side suggestions for compromise. The matter was set
at rest by the Second Article of Lord Ashburton’s Treaty,
St. George’s Island being assigned to the United States, and
a compromise line being drawn from Lake Superior to Rainy
Lake. The channels along the whole boundary line from the <span class="sidenote">The Ashburton Treaty and the Treaty of 1871.</span>
point where it strikes the St. Lawrence are open to both
nations; and by the Twenty-sixth Article of the Treaty of
Washington, dated the 8th of May, 1871, the navigation
of the St. Lawrence, from the point where it is intersected <span class="sidenote">Navigation of the St. Lawrence.</span>

<p class="noindent">‘according to justice and mutual convenience and in
conformity to the intent of’</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the 1783 Treaty.</p>

<p>The Fifth Article of the unratified Treaty of 1803 provided
that a direct line should be drawn from the North-West point
of the Lake of the Woods to the nearest source of the Mississippi,
leaving it to three Commissioners to fix the two points
in question and to draw the line. A further attempt at
adjustment was made in 1806-7, when the negotiators provisionally
agreed to an Article to the effect that the line
should be drawn from the most North-Western point of the
Lake of the Woods to the 49th parallel of latitude, and from
that point due West along the parallel</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘as far as the respective territories extend in that quarter’.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This solution again was not carried into effect; and though
the subject was raised in the negotiations which preceded
the Treaty of Ghent in 1814, no mention was made of it in
the Treaty itself. Eventually, however, on the 20th of October, <span class="sidenote">The Convention of 1818.</span>
1818, a Convention was signed in London, the Second Article
of which ran as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>‘It is agreed that a line drawn from the most North-Western
point of the Lake of the Woods along the 49th
parallel of North latitude or, if the said point shall not be
in the 49th parallel of North latitude, then that a line
drawn from the said point due North or South, as the case
may be, until the said line shall intersect the said parallel
of North latitude, and from the point of such intersection
due West along and with the said parallel, shall be the line
of demarcation between the territories of His Britannic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
Majesty and those of the United States, and that the said <span class="sidenote">First mention in the boundary agreements of the 49th Parallel and the Rocky Mountains.</span>
line shall form the Southern boundary of the said territories
of His Britannic Majesty and the Northern boundary of
the territories of the United States from the Lake of the
Woods to the Stony Mountains.’<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Here the Rocky Mountains, under the name of the Stony
Mountains, first come in, their existence having been unknown,
except by vague report, when the Peace of 1783
was signed.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>Geographical knowledge was creeping on, but the wording
of the Article shows that it was still uncertain whether the
North-Westernmost point of the Lake of the Woods was
North or South of the 49th parallel. This doubt was finally
cleared up by the Commissioners who, as already stated,
reported in October, 1826, and who fixed the point in question
in 49° 23′ 55″ North; thus, when Lord Ashburton negotiated <span class="sidenote">The boundary line as far as the Rocky Mountains finally determined by the Ashburton Treaty.</span>
the 1842 Treaty, it was only left for him, adopting the point
which the Commissioners had fixed, to lay down in the Second
Article that the boundary line ran</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">‘thence, according to existing treaties, due South to its
intersection with the 49th parallel of North latitude, and
along that parallel to the Rocky Mountains’.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The 49th parallel runs through the Lake of the Woods, but
the anterior provision that the boundary line should be
carried to the North-Westernmost point of the lake, coupled
with the fact that that point had been already determined,
necessitated an unnatural and inconvenient diversion of the
frontier line first to the North-West and then due South again,
thereby including in American territory a small corner of land
which should clearly have been assigned to Canada. For <span class="sidenote">The Ashburton Treaty finally determined the points arising out of the wording of the Treaty of 1783.</span>
this result Lord Ashburton has been blamed, as he was
blamed in the matter of the Maine boundary, but in either
case his hands were tied by previous negotiations and the
wording of existing treaties. A fair review of the whole
subject leads to the conclusion that the Treaty of Washington
in 1842 was a not inadequate compromise of the almost
insuperable difficulties which the wording of the original
Treaty of 1783 had left outstanding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Later
boundary
questions.</div>

<p>In tracing the evolution of the boundary between Canada
and the United States we have now reached the point where
the 1783 Treaty ceased to operate, and have seen that the
negotiations connected with the interpretation of the Treaty
resulted in the line of demarcation being carried far beyond
that point, viz., the head of the Mississippi, up to the range
of the Rocky Mountains. Meanwhile the Pacific Coast had
begun to attract attention, and a new crop of international
questions had come into existence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Oregon
boundary
dispute.</div>

<p>The Western territory in dispute between the two nations
was known as the Oregon or Columbia territory, and it lay
between the 42nd degree of North latitude and the Russian
line in 54° 40′ North latitude. The Columbia river took its
name from the fact that it had been entered in May, 1792,
by an American ship from Boston named the <i>Columbia</i>,
commanded by Captain Gray, who thus claimed to be the
discoverer of the river. In 1805 Lewis and Clark, the first
Americans to cross the continent, reached its head waters and
followed the river down to the sea. In 1811 an American
trading settlement was planted at Astoria near its mouth.
This settlement was voluntarily surrendered to Great Britain
in the war which followed shortly afterwards, but was restored,
without prejudice, to the United States under the general
restitution article of the Treaty of Ghent. The Third Article
of the subsequent Treaty of October 20th, 1818, provided that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">‘any country that may be claimed by either party on the
North-West coast of America, Westward of the Stony Mountains,
shall, together with its harbours, bays, and creeks and
the navigation of all rivers within the same, be free and
open for the term of 10 years’</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">to both Powers, without prejudice to the claims either of
themselves or of foreign Powers; and this Article was, by
a Convention of 6th of August, 1827, indefinitely prolonged—subject
to one year’s notice on either side—all claims
being, as before, reserved. This last Convention was concluded,
as its terms specified, in order to prevent all hazard
of misunderstanding and to give time for maturing measures
for a more definite settlement.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
position
in 1842.</div>

<p>On this basis matters stood in 1842, when the Ashburton
Treaty was signed. There was joint occupation of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
Oregon territory by British and American subjects, and
freedom of trade for both. Lord Ashburton had been empowered
to negotiate for a settlement of the North-Western
as well as the North-Eastern frontier line; but the latter, which
involved the question of the Maine—New Brunswick boundary,
being the more pressing matter, it was thought well to
allow the determination of the line West of the Rocky Mountains
to stand over for the moment. As soon as Lord Ashburton’s
Treaty had been signed at Washington in August,
1842, Lord Aberdeen, then Foreign Secretary in Sir Robert
Peel’s Ministry, made overtures to the United States with a
view to an early settlement of the Oregon question. A long
diplomatic controversy ensued, complicated by changes of
government in the United States, and tending, as is constantly
the case in such negotiations, to greater instead of
less divergence of view.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The rival
claims.</div>

<p>The Americans contended that they had a title to the
whole territory up to the Russian line, and they claimed
the entire region drained by the Columbia river. As a compromise,
however, they had already, in the negotiations
which ended in the Convention of 1827, suggested that the
boundary line along the 49th parallel should be continued
as far as the Pacific, the navigation of the Columbia river
being left open to both nations. This offer was repeated as
the controversy went on, with the exception that on the
one hand free navigation of the Columbia river was excluded,
and on the other the American Secretary of State proposed</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">‘to make free to Great Britain any port or ports on Vancouver’s
Island, south of this parallel, which the British
Government may desire’.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The counter British proposal was to the effect that the
boundary line should be continued along the 49th parallel
until it intersected the North-Eastern branch of the Columbia
river, and that then the line of the river should be followed
to its mouth, giving to Great Britain all the country on the
north of the river and to the United States all on the south,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
the navigation of the river being free to both nations, and
a detached strip of coast land to the north of the river being
also conceded to the United States, with the further understanding
that any port or ports, either on the mainland
or on Vancouver Island, South of the 49th parallel, to which
the United States might wish to have access, should be constituted
free ports.</p>

<p>The arguments advanced on both sides, based on alleged
priority of discovery and settlement and on the construction
of previous treaties, are contained in the Blue Book of 1846,
and are too voluminous to be repeated here. The controversy
went on from 1842 to 1846; and, when the spring of the
latter year was reached, the Americans had withdrawn their
previous offer and had refused a British proposal to submit
the whole matter to arbitration. There was thus a complete
deadlock, but shortly afterwards a debate in Congress showed
a desire on the American side to effect a friendly settlement
of a dispute which had become dangerous, and, the opportunity
being promptly taken by the British Government, a Draft
Treaty was sent out by Lord Aberdeen, which was submitted
by President Polk to the Senate, who by a large majority
advised him to accept it.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> The Treaty was accordingly
<span class="sidenote">Settlement of the Oregon boundary question by the Treaty of 1846.</span>
signed at Washington on the 15th of June, 1846. By the
First Article the boundary line was</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘continued Westward along the said forty-ninth parallel
of North latitude to the middle of the channel which
separates the continent from Vancouver Island, and thence
Southerly, through the middle of the said channel and of
Fuca’s Straits, to the Pacific Ocean’,</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">the navigation of the channel and straits South of the 49th
parallel being left free and open to both nations. By the
Second Article of the same Treaty, the navigation of the
Columbia river, from the point where the 49th parallel intersects
its great Northern branch, was left open to the Hudson’s
Bay Company and to all British subjects trading with the
same. The effect of the Treaty was that Great Britain
abandoned the claim to the line of the Columbia river, and
the United States modified its proposal to adopt the 49th<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
parallel as the boundary so far as to concede the whole of
Vancouver Island to Great Britain. The news that the
treaty had been signed reached England just as Sir Robert
Peel’s ministry was going out of office.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The San
Juan
boundary
question.</div>

<p>The delimitation of the boundary which the Treaty had
affirmed gave rise to a further difficulty. The Treaty having
provided that the sea line was to be drawn southerly through
the middle of the channel which separates Vancouver Island
from the continent and of Fuca’s Straits into the Pacific
Ocean, the two nations were unable to agree as to what was
the middle of the channel in the Gulf of Georgia between the
Southern end of Vancouver Island and the North American
coast. The main question at issue was the ownership of the
island of San Juan, and the subject of dispute was for this
reason known as the San Juan boundary question. The
British claim was that the line should be drawn to the Eastward
of the island, down what was known as the Rosario
Straits. The Americans contended that it should be drawn
on the Western side, following the Canal de Haro or Haro
Channel. Eventually it was laid down by the 34th and <span class="sidenote">Arbitration under the Treaty of 1871.</span>
following Articles of the Treaty of Washington of 8th of May,
1871—the same Treaty which provided for arbitration on the
<i>Alabama</i> question—that the Emperor of Germany should
arbitrate as to which of the two claims was most in accordance
with the true interpretation of the Treaty of 1846, and that
his award should be absolutely final and conclusive. On
the 21st of October, 1872, the arbitrator gave his award in
favour of the United States, and it was immediately carried
into effect, thus completing the boundary line from the
Atlantic to the Pacific.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Alaska
boundary
question.</div>

<p>In a message to Congress on the subject of the San Juan
Boundary Award, President Grant stated</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘The Award leaves us, for the first time in the history
of the United States as a nation, without a question of
disputed boundary between our territory and the possessions
of Great Britain on this continent;’</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and he suggested that a joint Commission should determine
the line between the Alaska territory and the conterminous
possessions of Great Britain, on the hypothesis that here
there was no ground of dispute and that all that was required<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
was the actual delimitation of an already admitted boundary
line. The matter proved to be more complex than the
President’s words implied.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Russian
America
ceded to
the
United
States.</div>

<p>By a Treaty signed on the 30th of March, 1867, the territory
now known as Alaska was ceded by Russia to the United
States. It was the year in which the Dominion Act was
passed; and, when British Columbia<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> in 1871 joined the
Dominion, Canada became, in respect of that province, as
well as in regard to the Yukon Territory, a party to the
Alaska boundary question. The limits of Russian America,
as it was then called, had been fixed as far back as 1825,
when, by a treaty between Great Britain and Russia, dated <span class="sidenote">Line of demarcation between British and Russian possessions in North America drawn in 1825.</span>
the 28th of February in that year, a line of demarcation was
fixed between British and Russian possessions</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="noindent">‘upon the coast of the continent and the islands of America
to the North-West’.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">The line started from the Southernmost point of Prince of
Wales Island, which point was defined as lying in the parallel
of 54° 40′ North latitude and between the 131st and 133rd
degrees of West longitude. It was carried thence to the
North, along the channel called Portland Channel, up to that
point of the continent where it intersected the 56th parallel
of North latitude. From this point it followed the summit
of the mountains parallel to the coast until it intersected
the 141st degree of West longitude, and was carried along
that meridian to the Arctic Ocean. The Treaty provided
that the whole of Prince of Wales Island should belong to
Russia, and that wherever the summit of the mountains
running parallel to the coast between the 56th parallel of
North latitude and the point where the boundary line intersected
the 141st meridian was proved to be at a distance of
more than 10 marine leagues from the ocean, the line should
be drawn parallel to the windings of the coast at a distance
from it never exceeding 10 marine leagues.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Free
navigation
of
rivers.</div>

<p>Free navigation of the rivers which flowed into the Pacific
Ocean across the strip of coast assigned to Russia was conceded
in perpetuity to British subjects; and, after the transfer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
of Russian America to the United States, the Twenty-sixth
Article of the Treaty of Washington of 1871 provided that
the navigation of the rivers Yukon, Porcupine, and Stikine
should for ever remain free and open to both British and
American citizens, subject to such laws and regulations of
either country within its own territory as were not inconsistent
with the privilege of free navigation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Negotiations
for
a settlement
of the
boundary
with the
United
States.</div>

<p>In 1872, the year after the entry of British Columbia into
the Dominion of Canada, mining being contemplated in the
northern part of British Columbia, overtures were, at the
instance of the Canadian Government, made to the United
States to demarcate the boundary, which had never yet been
surveyed and delimited. The probable cost of a survey
caused delay, and no action had been taken when in 1875
and 1876 disputes arose as to the boundary line on the Stikine
river. The Canadian Government in 1877 dispatched an
engineer to ascertain approximately the line on the river,
and the result of his survey was in the following year provisionally
accepted by the United States as a temporary
arrangement, without prejudice to a final settlement. Negotiations
began again about 1884, and, by a Convention signed <span class="sidenote">The Convention of 1892.</span>
at Washington on the 22nd of July, 1892, it was provided
that a coincident or joint survey should be undertaken of
the territory adjacent to the boundary line from the latitude
of 54° 40′ North to the point where the line intersects the
141st degree of West longitude. It was added that, as soon
as practicable after the report or reports had been received,
the two governments should proceed to consider and establish
the boundary line. The time within which the results of
the survey were to be reported was, by a supplementary
Convention, extended to the 31st of December, 1895, and
on that date a joint report was made, but no action was
taken upon it at the time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Discovery
of
gold at
Klondyke.</div>

<p>In 1896 the Klondyke goldfields were discovered in what
now constitutes the Yukon district of the North-West Territories,
and in the following year there was a large immigration
into the district. The goldfields were most accessible by the
passes beyond the head of the inlet known as the Lynn canal,
the opening of which into the sea is within what had been
the Russian fringe of coast. The necessity therefore for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
determining the boundary became more urgent than before.
In 1898 the British Government proposed that the matter <span class="sidenote">Further negotiations.</span>
should be referred to three Commissioners, one appointed
by each government and the third by a neutral power; and
that, pending a settlement, a <i>modus vivendi</i> should be arranged.
A provisional boundary in this quarter was accordingly
agreed upon, but, instead of the Commission which had
been proposed, representatives of Great Britain and the
United States alone met in 1898 and 1899 to discuss and if
possible settle various questions at issue between the two
nations, among them being the Alaska boundary. They
were to endeavour to come to an agreement as to provisions
for the delimitation of the boundary</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="noindent">‘by legal and scientific experts, if the Commission should
so decide, or otherwise’,</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">memoranda of the views held on either side being furnished
in advance of the sittings of the Commission. Again no
settlement was effected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Convention
of 1903.
Joint
Commission
appointed.</div>

<p>The dispute between Great Britain and Venezuela as to
the boundary between Venezuela and British Guiana, in
which the Government of the United States had intervened,
had, by a Convention signed in February, 1897, been referred
to arbitration, the Arbitrators being five in number, two
Englishmen, two Americans, and one representative of a
neutral State. In July, 1899, before the award in this
arbitration had been given, Lord Salisbury proposed to the
American Government that a treaty on identical lines with
the Venezuela boundary Convention should apply arbitration
to the Alaska Boundary question. To this procedure, giving
a casting vote on the whole question to a representative of
a neutral power, the American Government took exception,
and suggested instead a Tribunal consisting of ‘Six impartial
Jurists of repute’, three to be appointed by the President
of the United States and three by Her Britannic Majesty.
A suggestion made by the British Government that one of
the three Arbitrators on either side should be a subject of
a neutral state was not accepted; and eventually, on the
24th of January, 1903, a Convention was signed at Washington,
constituting a tribunal in accordance with the American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
conditions. The three British representatives were the Lord
Chief Justice of England and two leading Canadians, one of them
being the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Quebec.</p>

<p>The preamble of the Convention stated that its object was
a ‘friendly and final adjustment’ of the differences which
had arisen as to the ‘true meaning and application’ of the
clauses in the Anglo-Russian Treaty of 1825 which referred
to the Alaska boundary. The tribunal was to decide where <span class="sidenote">Points for decision.</span>
the line was intended to begin; what channel was the Portland
Channel; how the line should be drawn from the point
of commencement to the entrance to the Portland Channel;
to what point on the 56th parallel and by what course it
should be drawn from the head of the Portland Channel;
what interpretation should be given to the provision in the
Treaty of 1825 that from the 56th parallel to the point where
the 141st degree of longitude was intersected the line should
follow the crest of the mountains running parallel to the
coast at a distance nowhere exceeding ten marine leagues
from the ocean; and what were the mountains, if any, which
were indicated by the treaty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Main
point at
issue.</div>

<p>The main point at issue was whether the ten leagues should
be measured from the open sea or from the heads of the
inlets, some of which ran far into the land. If the latter
interpretation were adopted, the result would be to give to
the United States control of the main lines of communication
with the Klondyke Mining district, just as the Maine boundary
threatened to cut, and in large measure did cut, communication
between the Maritime Provinces and Quebec.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Award.</div>

<p>The Convention provided that all questions considered by
the tribunal, including the final award, should be decided
by a majority of the Arbitrators. The tribunal was unanimous
in deciding that the point of commencement of the
line was Cape Muzon, the Southernmost point of Dall Island
on the Western or ocean side of Prince of Wales Island. A
unanimous opinion was also given to the effect that the
Portland Channel is the channel which runs from about
55°56′ North latitude and passes seawards to the North of
Pearse and Wales Islands; but on all subsequent points
there was a division of opinion, the three American representatives
and the Lord Chief Justice of England giving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
a majority award from which the two Canadian members
of the tribunal most strongly dissented. The majority
decided that the outlet of the Portland Channel to the sea
was to be identified with the strait known as Tongass Channel,
and that the line should be drawn along that channel and
pass to the South of two islands named Sitklan and Khannaghunut
islands, thus vesting the ownership of those islands
in the United States. They also decided that the boundary
line from the 56th parallel of North latitude to the point of
intersection with the 141st degree of West longitude should
run round the heads of the inlets and not cross them. One
section of the line was not fully determined owing to the
want of an adequate survey. The net result of the award
was to substantiate the American claims, to give to the
United States full command of the sea approaches to the
Klondyke Mining districts, and to include within American
territory two islands hard by the prospective terminus of
a new Trans-Canadian Railway.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Behring
Sea
arbitration.</div>

<p>It may be added that the Treaty of 30th March, 1867,
by which Alaska was transferred from Russia to the United
States, gave rise not only to the territorial boundary dispute
of which an account has been given above, but also to a controversy
as to American and British rights in the Behring
Sea, more especially in connexion with the taking of seals.
The questions at issue were settled at a much earlier date
than the land boundary, having been, by a treaty signed at
Washington on the 29th of February, 1892, referred to a
tribunal of seven arbitrators, two named by the United
States, two by Great Britain, and one each by the President
of the French Republic, the King of Italy, and the King of
Sweden and Norway. The arbitrators met in Paris and
gave their award on the 15th of August, 1893, the substance
of the award, as concurred in by the majority of the arbitrators,
being that Russia had not exercised any exclusive rights of
jurisdiction in Behring Sea or any exclusive rights to the
seal fisheries in that sea outside the ordinary three-mile limit,
and that no such rights had passed to the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Treaty of
April 11,

<p>The last phase in the evolution of the Boundary line
between Canada and the United States is the Treaty of
11th of April, 1908, ‘for the delimitation of International<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
Boundaries between Canada and the United States’, by
which machinery is provided ‘for the more complete definition
and demarcation of the International Boundary’, and for
settling any small outstanding points such as, e.g., the boundary
line through Passamaquoddy Bay.</p>
